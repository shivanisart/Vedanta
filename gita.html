 <h1><em>The Bhagwad Gita</em></h1>
    <p>
  An exploration by Shivani Mathur<br>
  The Bhagwad Gita is a discourse from Shri Krishna to Arjuna, delivered moments before the greatest battle of his life. 
       
 </p>
 
<br>
        In this section:<br>

  A question that is often asked: Is it possible to follow the teachings of Vedanta and the Upanishads while still living a worldly life?

    This is where the Bhagavad Gita steps in. The Bhagavad Gita comprises 700 verses embedded in the Mahabharata. 
      It applies the teachings of Vedanta to resolve the conflict of someone embedded in the material world—a family of squabbling kings. 
   The conflicts in this family  mirror the complexities of our material existence. 
        There is a power struggle laced with moral dilemmas: compassion that paralyses action, a war sparked by disputes over land,
        driven by ambition, betrayal, injustice, even acts of violence and dishonour towards women. 
        Every human challenge is present for which the Gita offers a path to clarity, purpose, and inner resolve.
    Most interesting of all,  the solution to nearly every problem is identicle. 
</p>

    <br>In doing so, the Gita guides us—those who are embedded in the material world—to realize that our conflicts too, 
      like those of Arjuna, can be resolved by following the path of Vedanta. 
    <br>Every one of us is Arjuna.
    <br><br>

    <em style="color: white; font-style: italic;">The Context of the Bhagavad Gita</em><br>
    Arjuna, the central character, is the world’s best archer—a warrior who, on the eve of battle, becomes dejected and wishes to withdraw. 

    The battle is within his own family—a bid to reclaim a kingdom from his cousins, the Kauravas, that rightfully belongs to him and his brothers, the Pandavas.
      Despite several rounds of negotiations, Duryodhana, the head of the Kauravas, refused to yield even "the size of the point of a needle."

    Since the same teachers trained both sides, the battlefield pits Arjuna against family, friends, and mentors. 
      Though prepared, he loses his nerve at the moment of battle. He does not want to kill his guru or kin. 
      He rejects a Pyrrhic, blood-stained victory.

   <p>
  The Gita is a narration of the moment just before the war begins.  
  <br><br>
  Sanjay, the narrator, recounts the scene to the blind king Dhritarashtra, father of the Kauravas, on Day 10 of the war—shortly after Bhishma Pitamah,
       the most revered elder of the Kaurava army, has fallen.  
  <br><br>
  Sanjay, who had been Bhishma’s charioteer, returns to the palace to describe the events leading up to the war. 
       He narrates the moment when Arjuna, the lead warrior of the Pandavas, finds himself in deep moral conflict and
       turns to his charioteer Krishna—an avatar of God—for guidance, just before the first arrow is shot.
</p>

    <br><br>The first twenty eight verses of chapter one of the Gita  which has a total of 47 verses, are devoted to 
      building up the environment. Sanjay is describing the battlefield to Dhritarashtra giving the lineage and credentials of the warroirs on 
      both sides.
   The conch is blown to announce the begining of war.
      Amidst this grandeur and after the announcement of war, Krishan, Arjun's charioteer pull in the chariot to the centre of the battlefield.
      It is at this monent when Arjuna gets cold feet.    His issue isn’t insecurity about his ability; his problem is an emotional one. 

    <br>The Gita is a sophisticated text—perhaps the most widely read of all Vedantic works. It is a masterclass in both content and delivery: persuasion, strategy, and timing.
      Krishna, as Arjuna’s charioteer, must ensure Arjuna does not withdraw—not out of fear, but because surrender would mean the triumph of deceit and Adharma. 
      Such a collapse of dharma would unravel the moral fabric of society.
      It is interesting to note that in the structure of the Gita itself, we see the methodology of Vedanta described in     <a href="index.html"><i class="this section"></i></a>
As a mentor, Krishna imparts wisdom, but the experience, understanding of the teachings, and ultimately, decision-making are left to Arjuna. Arjuna must reach his own determination.
      Indeed the gita ends ( Chapter 18:63) with the verse <br> इति ते ज्ञानम् आख्यातम् गुह्याद्गुह्यतरं मया।<br>
विमृश्यैतदशेषेण यथेच्छसि तथा कुरु॥

<br>Thus, I have explained to you this wisdom—more secret than all secrets.
Reflect on it fully, and then do as you wish.

<br>
<br>Throughout the Gita, Krishna does not attempt to solve Arjuna’s dilemma. 
<br>He acknowledges that Arjuna’s fear—that his loved ones will be slain—is entirely valid and likely to unfold just as anticipated. 
<br>Yet, Krishna offers no comfort, no assurances, and no promise of a different outcome.

<br><br>Instead, he offers a radical shift in perspective—one that empowers Arjuna to find clarity on his own. 
<br>Krishna launches into a profound discourse, not to change the situation, but to show that the situation itself is not the true problem.

<br><br>Pujya Swami Dayananda captures this shift beautifully:
<br><i>“In psychology, there is no solution (to an emotional problem).<br>In Vedanta, there is no problem (in having an emotional problem).”</i>

<br><br>Vedanta teaches that even when a problem exists, one can still be okay. 
    Many religions and philosophical discourses say the same thing - to "bear it" and "ride it out". Vedant explains why
the problem need not be solved or removed. <br>It exists only within one of the four levels of reality that you experience.  <a href="what.html"><i class="this section"></i></a>

<br><br>Even if everything unfolds exactly as feared, you will only suffer in a temporary realm of existance. You are larger than the situation. 
<br>Therefore, do not fear.


    <br>
    <br><em style="color: white; font-style: italic;">Notable Omissions:</em><br>   <br>
      <p>
  Conspicuously absent from Krishna’s approach is any focus on battle plans, weapons, or enemies. 
  Although the Bhagavad Gita unfolds moments before the war is about to begin, the dialogue avoids military strategy. 
  Krishna does not address Arjuna’s emotional rant about fighting Bhishma, Drona, or other loved ones. 
  He offers no counsel on war tactics, enemy weaknesses, alliances, or treaties.

  <br><br>
  The focus is on individual duty and ethical conduct.
          Krishna does not praise Arjuna’s gurus (his opponents), nor does he dwell on personal loss. 
  All emphasis is on self-reliance.

  <br><br>
  The idea of an "enemy" is redefined. Instead of focusing on external foes, the Gita highlights internal adversaries like desire and anger. 
  There is no attention to war methodology—only to intent, attitude, and the discernment between what is real and what is unreal.

  <br><br>
  The Gita is a roadmap to Moksha or freedom; and more urgently, a solution to Arjuna’s immediate personal dilemma: 
  by recognizing what is real (the Atman, justice, and righteousness) and what is temporary noise (wars, relationships, desires), 
  one can choose rightly, endure wisely, and act with clarity.

Chapter 2 of Gita 

Verses 11 - 25 of chapter 2 are dedicated to drawing Arjun’s attention to the u changing nature of the Atman. 
न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः ।
न चैव न भविष्यामः सर्वे वयमतः परम् ॥ 2-12॥
Translation:
“It is not that at any time (in the past), indeed, was I not, nor were you, nor these rulers of men. Nor shall we ever cease to be hereafter.”
(Here, Krishna is referring to the Atman.)
नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः।
उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः॥ 2:16
In this verse, Krishna distinguishes between the real (Atman) and the apparent (body).
To understand the nuance of Krishna’s teachings, it is key to understand the definition of what is “sat” or real.
Shankaracharya says that “real” has the quality of Trikāla Abādhitam—that which is non-negatable in the past, present, and future.
That which:
• Has no beginning (unborn, uncreated)
• Has no end (does not die)
• Does not change (for change implies destruction and rebirth)
What changes (our body) is not truly real. It is only apparently real.
Krishna points out to Arjuna that this truth has been clearly seen by the seers (Rishis):
“य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम्।
उभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते॥” 2:19
One-way Street:
Krishna tells Arjuna that the apparent reality (body, world, actions) cannot affect absolute reality (the Self),
but the absolute reality can (and does) affect the apparent.
“वेत्त्येनं नित्यमव्ययम् अजं न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।
कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम्॥” 2:21
Translation:
If your true self, my true self, and our collective true self is the Atman—indestructible, eternal, unborn, and inexhaustible—how can the Atman slay or be slain?
So when the body is slain, the Atman remains ‘as is.’
He further elaborates:
नैनं छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः ।
न चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुतः ॥ 2-23॥
Translation:
“Weapons cannot cleave it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot moisten it, and wind cannot dry it.” These are elements of the material world, therefore they do not affect the atman. 
Once again, Krishna urges Arjuna to fight—for the right cause, and without hesitation.
On the level of apparent reality, where society and relationships exist, his family may perish—but for the sake of justice.
Yet on the level of absolute reality, he neither kills nor is killed.
The Atman—the true Self—is eternal, untouched by the death of the body.
Chapter 25-30 

. Krishna shifts focus from the atma to the second and third level of reality - the sukshma shareera in it manifest form ( level 2)   and in its u manifest form ( third level of reality  what happens to them in level 2 


As I was discussing the profound teachings imparted by Krishna to Arjuna—about the levels of reality and how the Atman and Sukshma Sharira remain untouched—I was asked a very insightful question:

“I understand that Arjuna did not want to fight his family and teacher, but why must he fight at all? Why is it his duty?”so  what if the Atma dies not die? Why even kill the body ? 

It’s an excellent question.

It’s not enough to say that Arjuna should fight because the Atman and subtle body are eternal and unaffected by death. That may be true on the level of absolute reality, but Krishna’s guidance is not limited to that.

Arjuna must fight to uphold dharma—to stand for justice within the context of the material world, the first level of reality.

In this transactional reality, where society functions, the fabric of life is sustained by principles—fairness, justice, and ethical conduct. These are what we call Dharma. The word Dharma comes from the Sanskrit root dhri, meaning to hold or uphold. Dharma, then, is what holds society together—it binds individuals to a shared order of responsibility and truth.

When these principles are compromised, those who recognize the injustice must act—not because the eternal Self is harmed, but because a failure to act allows rot to grow unchecked in the systems we live within.

This message is not theoretical for me. For those who know me, I worked as a minority woman in the male-dominated industry of investment banking. While I was largely treated with respect, there were moments when I experienced clear discrimination.

It was not easy to take a stand—especially against a large corporation with more resources, time, and influence in the media than I could ever hope to match. But I chose to speak up. Because when injustice is left unchallenged, it doesn’t disappear—it festers.

In those moments, reading the Gita was a strong source of inner strength. Krishna’s words, his call to act in alignment with Dharma—even when the odds are stacked against you—gave me clarity and courage.

This is what Krishna is asking of Arjuna—not action from ego or emotion, but right action, grounded in duty and truth, for the sake of maintaining what holds our shared world together.



As the Gita progresses, this is precisely what Shri Krishna does . He then preempts the question my friend asked, with a  radical shift in perspective in verse 31- - of the second chapter from his teaching that at the fourth level his relatively will not die to 

How does this chapter of the Bhagwad Gita help us navigate loss of loved one? 

It was several years ago that one of my closest friend lost his mother who was ailing for awhile . In a moment of grief he said -  “ it’s not as if I didn’t know -  this  ( death) was not outside the realm of possibilities….. . But suddenly it feels so real . At the age of sixty , I feel like an orphan. “ 
It brought tears to my eyes and I have over the years learned that any loss we feel is real . It is as real as the loss that Arjun feels  on the battlefield. 
But as my friend wisely pointed out , Sri Kristalsi tells Arjun - 
Quote verse 2:27

Verse 55-58 
Shittt pragnya kakshana 
One whose pragnya ( wisdom) is stable 
It is precipitated by verse 53 where he describes samadhi as unwavering g exercise. Rooted in placing oneself in  Alignment  with god 
Now this is my interpretation- but god is in everything, so really samadhi is an unwavering focus in something ( anything) as long as the attitude is one of intense focus and without ulterior motives . 
It is not the mind that is absorbed By being in focus  but the intent that unwavering. What changes is not the behaviour but the attitude and motivation which guides the the behaviour 
Central to:
• Dharma – laws that express and maintain the universe
• Karma – the laws of cause and effect
• Samsara – the cycle of rebirth and death
• Moksha – spiritual liberation, the experience that is life’s supreme goal.
