 In Vedanta,  the path of discriminative knowledge—the capacity to discern the eternal Self 
           (Atman) from the impermanent material world (prakriti) is called Sankhya Yoga. 
           This is the only path that ultimately leads to moksha (liberation). 
           Sankhya Yoga is an understanding of universal truth - that we are  the infinite Bramha 
           which is the cause of everything in the universe. 

           Acquiring the wisdom  of Sankhya Yoga is a threefold practice: 
           shravan (listening), manan (reflecting), and nididhyasana (deep meditation or assimilation).
           The three paths, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga, are like tools that work within this process to help you attain the clarity and insight of Sankhya Yoga. 
           First, shravan is about listening to the wisdom of scriptures and sages with an open heart, without judging or overthinking.
           This aligns with Karma Yoga, the path of selfless action. 
           In Karma Yoga, you take the teachings you’ve heard and put them into practice by performing your duties with dedication, but without attachment to the outcomes and with clear 
           understanding that the outcome is nit entirely in your control. 
           It’s like you’re “living” shravan—executing what you’ve learned through mindful action, staying true to your dharma while keeping your ego in check.
           <br>Next, manan involves reasoning and reflecting to make the teachings logically consistent.
           This is where Jnana Yoga, the path of knowledge, comes in. Jnana Yoga is all about sharp inquiry, using your intellect to discern the eternal self from the temporary body and mind. 
           Through manan, you’re internalizing the wisdom, asking questions like, “What is real?” and breaking down illusions.
           It’s the mental clarity that sharpens Sankhya Yoga’s discriminative understanding. 
           <br> Finally, nididhyasana is about experiencing the truth directly, letting it sink into your being. 
           This connects to Bhakti Yoga, the path of devotion. 
           Bhakti Yoga is like a heartfelt surrender to the divine, where love and devotion make the truth of the self and Brahman a lived experience. Nididhyasana transforms intellectual knowledge into a profound, personal realization, like feeling the divine in every moment. So, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga, and Karma Yoga are tools that fuel the process of shravan, manan, and nididhyasana. 
           Together, they cultivate the discriminative wisdom of Sankhya Yoga, guiding you to understand your true nature and reach moksha.
           It’s like each path is a brushstroke painting the same picture of liberation.

                   The Rishis asked a powerful question:
Is there something that never changes, even when everything else does?
They noticed that:
Our bodies change constantly—growing, aging, healing.  
Our minds shift—happy one moment, worried the next.  
Even the world around us transforms—weather, politics, economies, relationships.  
But if everything changes, what holds it all together?
What is the unchanging essence that runs through all of it?
That’s what they set out to discover.
Through intense inquiry and self-exploration, they concluded that yes—there is a changeless essence, and it’s not “somewhere out there.”
It’s within us.
That unchanging essence is called Brahman.

          <p>
          
The Rishis described four states of existence - levels of realiity 
sthoola Shareera : our physical body (), or the material self which takes input from the five senses - touch smell sight hearing and taste. At this level a human being is motivated by pleasure and pain 
 sukshma shareera: our subtle body including mind and emotions—
The two states are ever-changing and in flux. These are apparent realities. They have a deep and interconnected existence. Our mind/ emotion/ motivation affects the body and vice versa . 
The third level is Sushupti—a state of being, rich with potential. It is an unmanifest reality. One way to think of it is that it is a flower waiting to blossom. It is the person we can become, but are not yet.  
Underlying these lies the Atman: a steady, constant, timeless, and unchanging reality. This Atman is the common thread running through everything in the universe. The collective of all is called Brahman—and we are that. “Tat Twam  Asi “The Rishi’s  found that beneath the ever-changing material world lies a substratum of unchanging, infinite, indivisible reality—they called it Brahman: the Absolute reality.  This is the unchanging, all-pervasive, timeless truth. The Self, or Brahman.   Everything else is like waves on the ocean—temporary forms of something deeper.
Each person, however, experiences their own version or perspective of Brahman ,  this ultimate reality,  at a time. influenced by our unique perceptions and experiences. This means that while we all perceive the same underlying reality, each of us experiences and understands it in our own distinct way.
By acknowledging this, Vedanta advocates tolerance for the perspectives of others.   </p>

                  Interestingly, modern physics echoes some of these ideas.
At the level of quantum mechanics, matter seems less “solid” than we think—it’s mostly empty space.
Particles pop in and out of existence; observation changes outcomes.
The deeper scientists look, the more reality seems to blur.
In this sense, science and Vedanta are not at odds.
Science describes how the universe works.
Vedanta asks who is experiencing it.

                  Think of your mind and body as a computer:
Your brain is the hardware.  
Your thoughts and emotions are like software.  
But you—your essential Self—are the electricity that powers it all.  
The programs may crash. The hardware might age.
But the electricity?
It’s untouched, unaffected.
Vedanta tells us:
You are not the computer. You are the power that enables it.
When we mistake ourselves for the software (emotions) or hardware (body), we suffer.
When we recognize ourselves as the unchanging essence, we are free.    </p>

                  The spiritual journey is not one you take alone.
The role of a Guru (spiritual teacher) is considered vital in Vedanta.
Why?
Because the truth we’re seeking is subtle.
It’s not something the eyes can see or the mind can grasp easily.
We’re looking for the seer—but we are also the seer!
So how do you” see”  the one who sees? This is the subject of the text Drig Dhrushti Vivek. 
The Guru is someone who has already seen, someone who can point us back to ourselves.
A Guru doesn’t give you a belief system; a true Guru gives you clarity by directing you to find your own evidence .
He or she helps remove ignorance, which is like a veil covering the Self.
And once that veil lifts, the Self shines on its own.
The methods of Vedanta emphasizes:
“Shravana” (listening to the teachings),
Example
“Manana” (reflecting on them), and
“Nididhyasana” (deep contemplation and experience . Example 
All of these are most effective when guided by a qualified teacher.

           Vedanta is not an abstract concept , but it’s deeply practical.
It’s not just about reading scriptures or chanting mantras.
It’s about transformation.
This transformation comes from a life of:
Essence – Focusing on what really matters.  
Discipline – Training the mind and senses, not as punishment, but as preparation.  
Focus – Directing your energy toward your deeper nature, not being tossed around by distractions.  
When we live like this, a strange thing happens:
Suffering becomes optional. 
Example.

        <p>
       In Vedanta, meditation isn’t about “feeling good” or “blissing out.”
It’s about directly experiencing the Self.
It begins by quieting the mind—not forcing it, but observing it.
When thoughts settle, what remains?
You.
Not the “you” with an identity or a to-do list, but the pure, unchanging awareness.
That stillness isn’t something you create; it’s something you uncover.
The Bhagavad Gita says:
“When the mind becomes still, the Self reveals itself.”

                   <p> Vedanta doesn’t ask you to reject the world.
You don’t have to live in a cave to be spiritual.
In fact, Vedanta teaches that everything in the material world is also Brahman, just temporarily shaped.
Your body, your job, your relationships—they’re not separate from the Self.
They’re expressions of it.
But we suffer when we cling to these expressions as if they’re permanent.
We identify with our roles, our past, our emotions.
The trick is not to reject the world, but to see through it.
Like realizing a movie is just light on a screen—beautiful, emotional, but not ultimately real.

                   One of the foundational ideas in Vedanta is samsara—the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.
Why does this happen?
Because of karma—our actions, desires, and attachments.
As long as we identify with the ego, we keep coming back, trying to fulfill unfinished business.
But there is a way out:
It’s called moksha, or liberation.
Moksha doesn’t mean going somewhere else.
It means waking up to what you already are—free, complete, infinite.
Once you realize that, there’s no need to return.
Not because you’re escaping, but because you’ve understood the dream
               </p>

                <p>
                 
Vedanta is not a religion, not a dogma, and not a philosophy It’s a mirror—held up to the seeker—so they can see who they’ve always been.It doesn’t tell you what to believe.It invites you to look within.
In a world chasing identity, status, and external success, Vedanta gently whispers:
“You are not what you think. You are far more.”
It’s not an escape from the world but a way to truly engage with it—with wisdom, detachment, and compassion.
The journey doesn’t end in a mountaintop or monastery.
It ends (and begins) in the laser faces  that you give to  your own being.
And in the stillness that emerges from the focus, everything is found, here and now.

                     Dear Mrs Mathur - the word that comes to my 58 year old brain when i think of you as a 15 year old is “breezy”. To me you seemed like a breath of fresh air - beautiful, approachable and carefree.

My fond memory of you was outside your home science classroom one day. I had taken first aid and was done early, while the girls in your class were still cooking. The delicious aromas wafted out into the verandah and the hall where we sat tying our figure of 8 bandages.

As soon as we were done, a few of us started loitering outside your classroom in the hope that when the bell rang some of our friends would invite us in and let us taste their cooking. We were, of course always hungry.
However, as we peeked and circled the room, some of the girls were getting distracted. That’s when one of the doors opened and there you were standing tall towering over us! I was petrified of getting into trouble and setting a bad example as head girl. We weren’t supposed to loiter after class. But you were so kind and took us by surprise actually. You invited us in and asked us to help judge the food!!
We were served a bit from each of the  20 or so dishes ( can’t remember the right number). They were all delicious and it was one of our best, most memorable days in Senior School :) 
Thank you for showing us the way…
Wish you many happy returns of the day Miss 💕 💕

                   Mrs Mathur or Kalpana Aunty was both my teacher and mother of a good school friend whose home I was continually in and out of. I have many fond memories of her grace, charm and warmth.    As a bookworm who hated household chores, and liked to live in her head, Kalpana Aunty drew me into appreciating the joys in the everyday!  I remember making my mothers life difficult after several classes on 'nutrition' in home science class.. because armed with this knowledge I would subject every meal at home to loud and withering scrutiny!  ... it was but Kalpana Aunty said you should...!  
        Some lessons you never forget!
        Happy 80th Kalpana  Aunty!

                    My memories of Mathur Aunty are of a young, impressionable me in Loreto Lucknow…in awe of this elegant, well-spoken lady who glided into our lives as if on a dream. Aunty’s bearing, just the way she holds herself, her selection of saris, the gracefulness of her draping that made her sashay as she walked, her silky hair in a bun…Mathur aunty has maintained that image in my memories over the years.  And then when she spoke, aunty had a warmth, a lilt in her voice and an acceptance and respect for who she was speaking to.  I love how she rolls her “rrrrs”, the way she says the word room comes evocatively to my mind even as I am writing this note.  She influenced how I walked, talked and thought as I watched and imbibed her demeanor and mannerisms. Wishing Mathur aunty a very happy 80th birthday, and a long life surround with love, good health and happiness.  Love, Shubhra<br>

                     Long time ago when young girls secured admission to one of the coveted convent schools in the culturally vibrant city of Lucknow, there could have been little doubt that it was in large part due to its great faculty. For a biased 15-year-old, Mrs Kalpana Mathur was the prima donna, a vision to behold: classy, genteel, always dressed to the nines, in addition to being perfection in speech and diction. I had no idea of the correct pronunciation of such basic words as ‘room’ or ‘truth’ (lose the stress in one and add in the other). She must have been the reason for a young girl’s abiding love in sarees and the woman she wants to grow into, on attaining adulthood.

Lesser mortals might have treated Home Science as academically-lite, but not Mrs Mathur. She would take it upon herself, mother-like, to educate the girls in everything remotely related to the subject – the house you live in, the food you eat, the clothes you wear, the resources at your disposal, and the environment around you. Mrs Mathur was not just a subject teacher at Loreto Convent, but also a one-woman finishing school for many a young students.

It was natural to feel envious of her daughter, in the same batch as us, for having Mrs Mathur as her mother. Four decades later, when Sunayana mirrors the same sartorial grace, blemish-less face and self-assured persona, it’s a no-brainer. She has her mom’s wonderful genes. As for us, we are lucky to have been schooled by a diva who has been an incredibly wonderful role model for us. Aarti (Vaish) Gupta

                  Ayesha Husaini:<br> 
                  Kalpana a dream to behold.<br> 

She glided through the long driveway towards the LSR  hostel.<br>
My first glimpse of her.<br> 
We, 18 yr olds, who wouldn’t care about anything, turned our heads...<br> 


There was something about her:<br> <br>
Mesmerizing ! <br> <br> 


“Stop staring” Nilofar nudged me <br> <br> 
“We are here to meet shivani Mathur” she said in her characteristic dulcet tones<br> 
‘Didn’t know Shivani was Royalty’ I thought. <br> 😆<br> 


She smiled. <br> <br>
Adding me to her already long list of fans for life. <br>
Believe it or not, I spent the next many months writing letters to aunty almost every week giving her all the hostel and Shivani news.<br>

I have always looked up to you, Aunty. <br> 
You are my inspiration,  my role model. <br> 
                And everytime you call me your third daughter my heart warms up. 

<br> Happy 80th You will always be the most stylish, sophisticated, classy sensitive and warm person I have known but most of all you are what  I can only  aspire  to be.<br> 

Love you loads and loads, Ayesha

                  Sujata:<br> Mango Motifs and More – Myriad Memories of Kalpana Aunty<br>
 
When I was about seven, I stayed with my uncle and aunt in Yamunanagar for a few days. One night, we were whisked to the pantry for dinner and told firmly to go to bed after we had finished eating, for there was a party on that evening.  Children were not to be seen or heard. 
 
My brothers went off to bed, but I couldn’t resist tiptoeing out and peering through a chink in the curtains, to see what all the fuss was about.  
 
It was a marvellous scene, with drinks and delicious little snacks and the air was filled with the sound of all kinds of voices.  As my eyes scanned the details, they suddenly stopped and focused on what seemed to me to be the loveliest lady I had ever seen.  She was seated not too far from the curtain, elegantly draped in a saree and she wore a yellow rose in her hair.  Suddenly she looked to her side and spotted me through the chink in the curtain.  She gave a big smile and beckoned.
 
I was unsure.  Many rules would be broken if I ventured forth, but I couldn’t resist.  I stepped out hesitantly and went up to her.  She was like a beam of sunshine, and I immensely enjoyed talking to her (as it turned out, I wasn’t admonished either).
 
That was my first meeting with Kalpana Aunty, and each time we meet, it is as though we are swept back to a time when life unfolded in a simple, joyous way, with time enough to do everything and more.  That is how I think about her always.
 
Some years later, we all stayed together for several months in Delhi in my grandfather’s house.  I remember returning from school every day in time to watch Kalpana Aunty making and handing out perfect paans.  The air was always full of conversation, sometimes there was a new game to play or a new thought to ponder over.  Life was never still with her around.
 
Soon it was time for the Mathurs to move to their house near Chanakyapuri.  I could see that they were greatly looking forward to settling into their home, but I missed the whole family.  However, Kalpana Aunty had left behind a few memories that were special for me.
 
Her suddenly ushering me into an old wooden chair and giving me a wonderful new haircut.  Measuring me for size and stitching some clothes that fit me really well (I held onto these long after I outgrew them because they were so perfectly made).  Sitting with my palm upturned, while she decided on a mehndi pattern to draw out. “She will make a mango,” predicted Shivani.  “That’s her favourite.”  And indeed, she did.  I knew school rules forbade mehndi but I didn’t care.  It looked so beautiful!  As it turned out, I wasn’t admonished for this either.
 
Her sitting behind me at a late-night puppet show and periodically passing me some delectable mutton sandwiches she had made from dinner leftovers.
 
Many years passed and I would meet her briefly, from time to time.  I always wondered if I should spend a summer with her sometime and learn how to stitch my own clothes, make many of the delicacies that I had enjoyed eating at her house, and just watch her effortlessly creating mango motifs and other beautiful art.  But it never happened.
 
There now is a mango tree outside my bedroom window.  Sometimes, in the early afternoon, when the light is yellow gold and its dark green leaves rustle gently in the breeze, I think of her, and send her love and happiness.
 
Wishing you many happy birthdays ahead, Kalpana Aunty!

Vandana Pant <br><br>   

Kalpana Aunty, 

The legacy of a teacher’s contributions lies in the unique opportunity to live on in the minds of endless lives touched by 60 minute increments of interacting, learning and integrating the knowledge, perspective and approach put forth by that person in a classroom. 

The legacy of a mother’s life touches the friends of children as they traipse through homes, finding in the environments of their peers the personality of their parents in every corner - the decor, meals, activities that make up cherished everyday moments. 

I happen to have wonderful memories of both associations with you. 

Home Science in school, a dynamic project on marketing research that required wandering through random stores in Hazratganj gathering information on blenders, ovens and home appliances to determine differences in features and prices and availability. A project that inspired the geek in me for a lifetime and I’ve never stopped researching endlessly before any appliance or equipment purchase much to the chagrin of everyone in my family. 

But my most special memories are of being welcomed to spend endless hours and days at your home in Lucknow and later Delhi. Homes that carried an aesthetic that I always admired; meals that were so creative, and an environment that always felt both modern in thought and charming in its cultural traditions. 

There was also always your grace that was unmistakably woven into every detail. Marshmallows by the fireplace in your bedroom, Diwali rangoli in the hallway and verandahs, and for some reason my favorite - a cream colored stone statuette adjacent to a vibrant, large plant in the living room. 

I also remember with clarity, your very firm and non-negotiable “No’s” on certain asks for Nainoo to step beyond boundaries you had set. Tough lessons for a headstrong teenager (me, not her)!

Having met you last year, some 40+ years later, your presence rings just the same and it’s so wonderful to have this opportunity to wish you a joyous, special birthday that celebrates who you are. 

Happy 80th! 
Vandana

                    Aunty is a Woman of substance. I've always found Aunty extremely elegant, hospitable and sensitive to the needs of those around. She wears her achievements lightly and adjusts the level her conversations to her audience to make them feel comfortable. I have found her work with children and towards social causes extremely inspirational.<br><br>

<br>She is one of the most positive and gentle human beings I have ever come across

                  Aunty is the epitome of elegance with an infectious smile. She loves food and also showers her love through food. She makes the most amazing variety of chutney whenever I visit her and last time on dinner table she described how potato is her favourite vegetable . She had made the most delicious potato dish and we had a good laugh about how potato was hers and mine staple diet growing up .

                  Whenever I think of Kalpana aunty, the word 'grace' always comes to my mind.I particularly remember one Diwali a few years ago when she made the most unbelievably delicious vegetarian kebabs for me which I still dream about. And she did it so seemingly effortlessly! Would love to emulate that. 
A very very happy 80th birthday aunty and wish you many more years of happiness and health.
Much love

                     Kalpana aunty is one of the warmest, most affectionate and gracious people I have known. 
I met Kalpana aunty when I was single and living away from home for the first time in Bombay, and her warmth, hospitality and kindness made their Churchgate house my home away from home. I still fondly remember raiding her jars of pickled fruit - they were delicious - during late-night chatting sessions with Nainoo. My relationship with my now-husband Venkat began soon afterwards, and being able to discuss things with Kalpana aunty and get her advice was invaluable. Those months of always been made to feel welcome by Kalpana aunty whenever I came over have made them among my happiest and most treasured memories.    Aparna Garodia <br>
