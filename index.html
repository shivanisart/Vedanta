        <em>What is my purpose?</em><br><br>

        No matter who we are—how accomplished, beautiful, wealthy, healthy, or loved—we all face moments when life feels heavy. 
        Times when problems overwhelm us, self-doubt creeps in, and everything seems on the verge of falling apart. 
        Our relationships feel fragile, our work uncertain, and the love or security we once felt begins to fade.

        <br>
        When life is smooth, I feel energized and inspired. I notice the sunshine, the blooming flowers;
        I plan dinners out and sketch five-year visions for my career.

        <br>
        But in moments like these—the hard ones—I start to question everything:
        <br>
        What is my purpose?<br>
        Why was I born?<br>
        What is the meaning of life?
<br> I began to explore multiple paths:    <br>  
   
        My search for answers has taken me through history, religion, science, art, and even the volatile world of financial markets. Each discipline offered some wisdom.
<br>History teaches you history (of course it does!).
<br>The purpose of science is to understand the subject matter of science.
<br>But the purpose of Vedanta is not to understand the subject matter of Vedas or scriptures—
it is to gain mastery over the one who studies them: the Self.
To know the very core of our being—directly and immediately.

<br><br>The closest I’ve come to a comprehensive understanding—
one that silences my restlessness while provoking deeper curiosity—
is through applying the teachings of Vedanta to my own life.
       Vedanta permits you to challenge every thing the scriptures say . Indeed challenge is encouraged. 
   
        
<br>I am taking this path:<br>
To devote myself to the study of Vedanta,<br>
To memorize the seven hundred shlokas of the Bhagavad Gita,<br>
    To express what I comprehend in a visual. <br><br>
 People ask why I intend to memorize all 700 verses, “Isn’t understanding enough?” 
       <br> Memorization deepens understanding. 
        It’s like having a perfectly organized mental filing system, 
        one where every verse is instantly accessible.<br>
        This clarity allows connections to emerge effortlessly and vividly. The text doesn’t just sit in books; 
        it lives within you, shaping thought and insight in real time. <br>   
     
        <br><br>
        <em>What Vedanta is not</em>

        <br><br>
        Vedanta is not a religion, it is not a philosophy, 
        nor a belief system—and it certainly is not a concept.<br>
       Vedanta is about 'you' and you are not a concept or a philosophy! 
At its core Vedanta has a single goal:
       <br> Freedom (Moksha).<br>
        But here’s the paradox—Vedanta says we are already free.
        So how can freedom be a goal if we already have it? 
        It’s like saying, “My goal is to be a millionaire,” when your bank account already holds millions—
        The problem is that you just haven’t checked your account, so you don't know.

That’s exactly the point Vedanta makes: 
        The goal needs to be more precise. 
        The problem is not the absence of freedom, but ignorance of it. 
        So the goal isn’t to gain freedom—it’s to gain the knowledge that we are already free.
         
        <br> 
        
          The word <em>ved</em> itself means “knowledge”—not just any knowledge, but the most intimate kind: knowledge of the Self.
        Are there other paths to this discovery?
        Certainly. But many are long and winding. Vedanta offers a direct one.
        
          <br><br>
        <em>What Vedanta is </em>
 <br><br>
Vedanta provides a clear and practical method for Self-knowledge. It doesn’t bind you with rules or dogma. You are free to choose at every step—but those choices matter. 
        Missteps bring confusion and unnecessary suffering;
       but even through detours  you will ultimately arrive—because what you seeking, you already are.

        <br><br>
       
        You might think that knowing the Self should be simple. After all, it’s what’s closest to us. And yet, like missing the forest for the trees, our true nature often escapes us—precisely because it is so ever-present.
        <br><br>
        <em></em>
   
        
        <br><br> That’s why Vedanta provides more than concepts—it offers a process. A systematic method of inquiry to reveal what is already true. It is not a new idea; it is discovery. <br><br> <em>When this understanding dawns, it’s not theoretical. It reshapes how we perceive the world, make choices, connect with others, and live—in this moment, in this reality. It liberates us.</em> <br>The goal is singular: Freedom. <br> Freedom. <br><br> The path to this singular goal is also singular:<br> Self-knowledge. <br> The tools for attaining self-knowledge are many. Given my professional background, I created a chart to illustrate what progress might look like when you start. Notably, there is no time axis. That would be counterproductive. Freedom comes with contentment in the present—a certainty that nothing can unsettle you. This is possible only if no force in the world—time, space, power, or even yourself—can disturb you. <br>So here we are: <br> A single goal - Freedom<br> A single path - Self-knowledge <br> Multiple tools - Action with purpose and right intent, love and devotion, curiosity and inquiry. <br> No single tool is enough. Understanding how they work, applying them to our lives, and executing them is the essence of Vedanta.

        This stereoscopic image is a great metaphor for self-knowledge.
        At first, you don’t see the 3D image, it is hard. But when you focus without blinking, 
        the first thing that happens is that the blue balls seem to rise. 
        Then, all of a sudden, the picture turns glassy, 
        a bowl shaped like a crown with a  ball  appears.<br>
        The image is clear. There is no doubt. For most of us, 
        it takes persistance and time. 
        The image was always there, hidden in plain sight. Just like the Self: not something new to gain, but something to recognize. 
        Once seen, it’s unmistakably known.
        as with Vedanta there is no ' average ' time that you will definately see it in ! Each person has a unique experience. frustrating and exhiliarating.

        </video>
        
    </div>
        My motivation to explore Vedanta began in trying to understand myself in moments of despair. 
        But quickly, it became something more, a path I wanted to walk every day, everywhere, in everything I do.

    
        <em>The methodology of Vedanta</em>
        <br><br>
        Vedanta provides a structured way to inquire and discover the Self through clear, logical inquiry and experiential understanding. It is not blind faith or speculation but a rigorous journey inward.
      <div>

  <p>
    Vedanta teaches us how to think, not what to think.The methodology aims to radically shift our perspective by placing emphasis on three things ( not necessarily in this order)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shravan – Listening to the teachings with respect and openness.</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan – Reflecting and testing them against personal experience.</li>
    <li> Manan – Examining their logical consistency.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This three-pronged approach provides stability to our conclusions. Like a three-legged table offers the greatest stability—four legs might cause it to wobble, while fewer than three make it unstable.
  </p>

  <p>
  All that follows in this journey is part of step one.
      Steps two and three are yours alone. Two-thirds of this path must be walked by you.
  </p>

 <br><br>
        <em>Living in a material world </em>
            <br><br>
    For those of us who have chosen to live in the material world, Vedanta doesn't ask us to renounce. It offers context.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>How can we better manage relationships?</li>
    <li>How do we make decisions amid conflict?</li>
    <li>How do we cope with the loss, death and breakups?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to follow the Vedantic path while living fully?</li>
    <li>How can we handle misunderstandings, stress, and burnout?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
   Vedanta doesn’t deny emotions or circumstances. It shifts our perspective: we are more than the challenges we face. 
p>

  <p>
    <em style="color: white;">
            When we know we’ll emerge whole, stress fades. A crisis becomes a situation and the problem is reduced to one of temporary endurance.
    </em>
  </p>


 <br>
  <p>
  The choice ahead <br>

With this introduction to why I chose Vedanta, you now have options:
You can explore foundational themes, or leap into the Gita. It’s like choosing between abstract art (universal truths) or figurative painting (life examples). Both are profound and analytical. The choice is yours.

Or you may choose another path. That’s valid too. <br>The Rigveda says in verse 1.164.46 <br>
     
          <em> "एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"     </em>  <br>
Ekam sad viprā bahudhā vadanti  <br>  <br> 
      Translated: Truth is one; the wise express it in many ways. <br>All traditions point to the same truth.
      <br>
   
          <br>Eventually every one of us will realize the truth. When we do, the knowledge will set us free. 
      We won’t retreat from life—we’ll engage more fully, upholding justice, fairness, and compassion.  
      <br><em style="color: white;">The truth is that we are infinite, timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
      ... Vedant offers one path, a very direct path to this realisation.
