 <h1><em>Why Vedant.</em></h1>
    <p> An exploration by Shivani Mathur</p>
    <div class="header-description">
<br>
        In this section:<br>
       What is my purpose?<br>
       What Vedant is not.<br>
       Three words.<br>
       Methodology.<br>
        Living in the material world.

        <br><br>

        <em>What is my purpose?</em><br><br>

        No matter who we are—how accomplished, beautiful, wealthy, healthy, or loved—we all face moments when life feels heavy. Times when problems overwhelm us, self-doubt creeps in, and everything seems on the verge of falling apart. Our relationships feel fragile, our work uncertain, and the love or security we once felt begins to fade.

        <br><br>
        When life is smooth, I feel energized and inspired. I notice the sunshine, the blooming flowers; I plan dinners out and sketch five-year visions for my career.

        <br><br>
        But in moments like these—the hard ones—I start to question everything:
        <br>
        What is my purpose?<br>
        Why was I born?<br>
        What is the meaning of life?

        <br><br>
        My search for answers has taken me through history, religion, science, art, and even the volatile world of financial markets. 
        Each of these disciplines taught me wisdom in some aspect or another. But the closest I’ve come to real comprehensive understanding is through the teachings of Vedanta.

        <br><br>
        <em>What Vedanta is not</em>

        <br><br>
        Vedanta is not a religion, it is not a philosophy, 
        nor a belief system—and it certainly is not a concept.
        Vedant, at its core has a goal:
        Freedom (moksha).<br>
        But here’s the paradox—Vedanta says we are already free.
        So how can freedom be a goal if we already have it? 
        It’s like saying, “My goal is to be a millionaire,” when your bank account already holds millions—
        The problem is that you just haven’t checked.

That’s exactly the point Vedanta makes: 
        The goal therefore
        needs to be more precise. 
        The problem is not the absence of freedom, but ignorance of it. 
        So the goal isn’t to gain freedom—it’s to gain the knowledge that we are already free.
         
        <br> 
        
          The word <em>ved</em> itself means “knowledge”—not just any knowledge, but the most intimate kind: knowledge of the Self.
        Are there other paths to this discovery? Certainly. But many are long and winding. Vedanta offers a direct one
        
          <br><br>
        <em>What Vedanta is </em>

        <br><br>
   
Vedanta provides a clear and practical method for Self-knowledge. It doesn’t bind you with rules or dogma. You are free to choose at every step—but those choices matter. Missteps can lead to confusion and unnecessary suffering. Yet, no matter how many detours you take, you will ultimately arrive—because what you’re seeking, you already are.

Vedanta is not about mastering scriptures—it’s about mastering the one who studies them. It’s not about belief, but about direct, immediate realization of your own nature.
        <br><br>
        
      

 
 
        The purpose of history is to understand history, or the course of our the past.<br>
        The purpose of science is to understand science and oexplore the universe.<br>
        But the purpose of Vedanta is not to master the Vedas. It is to gain mastery over the one who studies them: the Self. To know the very core of our being—directly and immediately.        <br><br>
        
        <br><br>
        You might think that knowing the Self should be simple. After all, it’s what’s closest to us. And yet, like missing the forest for the trees, our true nature often escapes us—precisely because it is so ever-present.
        
<br><br>

        <br><br>
        <em>A structured methodology</em>

        <br><br>
        That’s why Vedanta offers more than ideas—it offers a process. A structured means of inquiry to uncover what is already true. In that sense, it is not a new thought; it is discovery.

        <br><br>
        <em>And when this knowledge arises, it’s not abstract. 
            It transforms how we see the world, how we make decisions, how we relate to others, and how we live—right here, right now.</em>
   <br><br>
        This stereoscopic image is a good representation of self knowledge.
        Look at it without blinking till you see the 3D image.
        It was always there in the picture. You don't immediately  
        see it, but once you do, you 'know it'

        <br><br>
        My motivation to explore Vedanta began in trying to understand myself in moments of despair. 
        But quickly, it became something more, a path I wanted to walk every day, everywhere, in everything I do.

        <br><br>
        <em>Three words</em>

        <br><br>
        They say the essence of all the Vedas can be distilled into just three words:

        <br><br>
        <strong><em>Tat Tvam Asi</em></strong> —<br>
       Chandogya Upanishad, Chapter 6, Verses 8.8–15

        <br><br>
        <strong>Translated:</strong> You are that.

        <br><br>
        What does it mean?<br>
        The words are simple; the implications, profound. In all likelihood, the first time you hear it, you are clueless as to what it means. That's okay. The true test is: Will understanding this statement set us free?

    </div>

    <div class="header-description">
        <br>
        Vedant says Yes - It will.<br>
       Freedom from suffering comes in the current life. It is not a prize to be won after death.<br>The heaven we talk about is here, now.</em>
        <br><br>
        Freedom comes with knowledge, not beliefs.<br>
        Knowledge that destroys misconceptions. Misconceptions are the source of suffering.
        <br><br>
        <em>The methodology of Vedanta</em>
        <br><br>
        Vedanta provides a structured way to inquire and discover the Self through clear, logical inquiry and experiential understanding. It is not blind faith or speculation but a rigorous journey inward.
      <div>

  <p>
    Vedanta has a goal—to gain self-knowledge and dispel misconceptions. It teaches us how to think, not what to think.The methodology aims to radically shift our perspective by placing emphasis on three things ( not necessarily in this order)
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>first listening to those who came before us, without judgement and with respect... ( shravan)</li>
    <li>next, verifying against our personal experiences if what we heard is true for us (niradyasna )</li>
    <li>and finally assesing it's logical consistency( manan).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This three-pronged approach provides stability to our conclusions. It’s often said that a three-legged table offers the greatest stability—four legs might cause it to wobble, while fewer than three make it unstable.
  </p>

  <p>
    For your own self-discovery, everything you read henceforth will be part of (1) above.<br>
    This means that logical conclusions and experiences can be done by you alone.<br>
    On our journey, two-thirds of our work must be our own…
  </p>

 <br><br>
        <em>Living in a material world </em>
            <br><br>
    For those of us who have chosen to live in the material world, Vedanta contextualizes our jobs, our relationships and our daily victories and failures within a larger framework.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>How can we better manage our relationships with loved ones?</li>
    <li>How do we navigate our daily decisions when conflicting fears and desires arise?</li>
    <li>How can we cope with the loss of loved ones, death, or breakups?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to follow the Vedantic path while still living a material life?</li>
    <li>How can we manage misunderstandings, stress, and burnout?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Without minimizing our roles, emotions, or circumstances, Vedant shows us a fresh perspective - we are more than the challenges we face—and this shift in perspective can transform a problem into a situation .
  </p>

  <p>
    <em style="color: white;">
      If we know that we will emerge unscathed from a problem, then the stress levels fall and the problem is reduced to one of temporary endurance.
    </em>
  </p>

  <p>
   
  </p>

  <p>
  
       With a brief introduction of why I chose the path of Vedanta, below are links to further contemplations. You can choose to explore what are the core foundational themes in Vedanta, or leap directly into the Gita.
      <br> Its the difference between looking at abstract art ( thefoundation themes are all encompassing truths)  vs figurative paintings ( gita gives real life examples). both are profound, capitivating and analytic. The choice is yours. 
        <br> You can also choose to exit, and seek self realization through a path other then Vedant. because it is said that you will eventually get there.... 
      <br>The Rigveda says in verse 1.164.46 <br>
     
          <em> "एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"     </em>  <br>
Ekam sad viprā bahudhā vadanti  <br>  <br> 
      Translated: Truth is one, the means of expressing it are manifold. <br>It highlights the essential unity underlying all spiritual traditions, even when they appear different on the surface.
      <br>
     The truth is that we are infinite, timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
          <br>Eventually every one of us will realize this, and when we do, this realization, this knowledge will set us free. We will not retreat from life, nor escape challenges by retreating into the mountains. 
          On the contrary,  as we navigate our lives, we uphold justice , fairnesss and compassion.
    Regardless of the outcome of our efforts, we never lose sight of this knowledge:
      <br><em style="color: white;">The truth is that we are infinite, timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
      ... Vedant offers one of the routes to this knowledge-   a very direct path.
