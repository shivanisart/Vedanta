        <em>Freedom</em><br>
   
        <em>What is my purpose?</em><br><br>

        No matter who we are—how accomplished, beautiful, wealthy, healthy, or loved—we all face moments when life feels heavy. 
        Times when problems overwhelm us, self-doubt creeps in, and everything seems on the verge of falling apart. 
        Our relationships feel fragile, our work uncertain, and the love or security we once felt begins to fade.

        <br>
        When life is smooth, I feel energized and inspired. I notice the sunshine, the blooming flowers;
        I plan dinners out and sketch five-year visions for my career.

        <br>
        But in moments like these—the hard ones—I start to question everything:
        <br>
        What is my purpose?<br>
        Why was I born?<br>
        What is the meaning of life?
<br><br>I began to explore multiple paths:    <br>  
   
        My search for answers has taken me through history, religion, science, art, and even the volatile world of financial markets. Each discipline offered some wisdom.
<br>History teaches you history (of course it does!).
<br>The purpose of science is to understand matter and our universe - the subject of science.
<br>But the purpose of Vedanta is not to understand the subject matter of Vedas or scriptures—
it is to gain mastery over the one who studies them: the Self.
To know the very core of our being—directly and immediately.

<br><br>The closest I’ve come to an experience 
that silences my restlessness while provoking deeper curiosity—
is through applying the methods of Vedanta to my own life.<br>
       What atracts me most is that Vedanta encourages you to challenge every thing Vedanta says .<br> Indeed many of the texts 
        are in the form of a dialogue where the student consistently, queries and challenges the guru.
        Challenge is encouraged, not disrespect. You are free 
        to disagree but not thrust your view on anyone. Vedanta, 
        in its own part does not
        require you to accept any teaching without 
        personal verification. Are there other paths to self-realization? 
        Certainly, Vedanta acknowledges this, 
        embracing diverse perspectives.
        However, many paths can be long and circuitous. 
        Rooted in its wisdom, Vedanta’s structured methodology, 
         question-and-answer sessions and abundant examples,
        offers a direct approach.
        Reading some of the Q&A style texts, I find that 
        some of the questions that arise in my mind have been raised in these texts.
         
<br>

     
        <p>My motivation to explore Vedanta began in trying to understand myself in moments of despair. 
        But quickly, it became something more, a path I wanted to walk every day, everywhere, in everything I do.
So I decided to study the Upanishads...  <br>
To memorize the seven hundred shlokas of the Bhagavad Gita,<br>
    As an artist and someone with a corporate background my natural inclination is to express what I comprehend visually and graphically. <br><br>
 People ask why I want to memorize all seven hundred verses, “Isn’t understanding enough?” 
       <br> <br>Memorization deepens understanding. 
        It’s like having a perfectly organized mental filing system, 
        one where every verse is instantly accessible.<br>
        This ease of retrieval allows connections to emerge effortlessly and vividly. The text doesn’t just sit in books; 
        it lives within you, shaping thought and insight in real time. <br> 
      
     </p>
             <p>  <em>Moksha</em>  </p>
     <p> Vedanta has only one goal-  Moksha. The word Moksha comes from “mo,” meaning release, and “sha,” meaning state—so it’s the state of being truly free. 
         
         As humans, we’re born with this innate freedom, but life’s layers—possessions, relationships, thoughts—can tangle us in attachment. 
         These attachments bring joy but also chain us.

        <p>Image above: picasso quoute - learn to undraw </p>
    </div>
     
        <br>But here’s the paradox—
        How can freedom be a goal if we were born with, and already have freedom? 
        It’s like saying, “My goal is to be a millionaire,” when your bank account already holds millions—
        The problem is that you just haven’t checked your account, so you don't know.
        

That’s exactly the point: 
        The goal needs to be more precise. 
        The problem is not the absence of freedom, but ignorance of it. 
        So the goal isn’t to gain freedom—it’s to gain the knowledge that we are already free - as we were born. 
        This freedom can be regained only through self-realization, where you awaken to your core essence. 
        <br> Moksha is that unshakable peace, pure bliss, or anand that comes with the realization
         that we are already free. <br>In this realization, we learn to navigate worldly pursuits with detachment, aligning them with our deeper truth.

           <em>What Vedanta is not</em>   </p>

     
        <p>   Vedanta is not a religion, it is not a philosophy, 
        nor a belief system—and it certainly is not a concept.<br>
       Vedanta is about 'you' and you are not a concept or a philosophy. 
        Nor it it any use to "know" about Vedanta if you don't apply it to 
        your life.    </p>

         
   
          <p>   <em>What Vedanta is </em>   </p>
    <p>
        
          The word Ved means knowledge—not just any knowledge,
        but the most intimate kind- a deep understanding of the self. 
        
           </p>
    <p>   <em>What is the 'Self'</em>   </p> 
    <p><em>Discovering Our True Nature: The Self</em></p>
<p>Our true nature—the <em>Self</em>—is infinite, indivisible, timeless, and ever-present. 
    It is not the body, mind, ego, emotions, memories, or impressions, which are all temporary. 
    Instead, the Self is <em>Sat-Chit-Ananda</em>—existence, awareness, and bliss—the eternal reality 
    that observes all but cannot be seen with the five senses. It is realized through inner inquiry.</p>
<p>For example, when you notice thoughts or feelings like anger or joy, you are the one observing them. 
    Those thoughts change, but the <em>you</em> watching remains constant. 
    By peeling away what changes—body, mind, or circumstances—you uncover the unchanging observer. A
    s a child grows, their body, appearance, and life transform, yet something endures. T
    his process, called <em>neti, neti</em> (“not this, not this”), reveals the Self. <a href="pages/neti.html" class="vedanta-button">Learn more about neti, neti</a></p>
<p><em>Why It Matters</em></p>
<p>Realizing the Self as unchanging and eternal grants unshakable confidence.
    No fleeting event—success, failure, or loss—can harm you, as you outlast them all. 
    Recognizing your infinite connection to the universe fosters compassion. 
    Just as you wouldn’t harm your own arm, you avoid harming others or the environment, seeing them as extensions of yourself. 
    Yet, with discernment, you act decisively to protect and sustain, like removing a cancerous limb to save the body.</p>
<p>Knowing the Self seems simple—it’s always with us. Yet, its constant presence makes it easy to overlook, 
    like missing the forest for the trees. 
    Vedanta offers a structured methodology, detailed in the  <a href="how.html" class="vedanta-button">More on methodology</a> to guide this discovery.</p>
<p>You are free to choose your path to discover the Self, 
    but choices matter.
    Missteps may lead to confusion or suffering, delaying the freedom and peace you seek and causingsorrow and turbulence in your life. 
    Through Vedanta’s disciplined inquiry, you uncover the truth you already are.</p>

  <p><em>
      The promise of Vedanta comes with an ask</em></p> 
         <p>
             
            The Self is ever present; it’s not something we schedule. It’s in every action, every thought, all day, every day. So the promise of Vedanta comes with an ask -  unwavering attention. 
             Self-knowledge is a lifelong process, not a one-time event, where every action 
             of ours becomes a prayer.
             Vedanta redefines prayer—not as a ritual to a distant god, 
             but as a continuous conversation with the infinite within, 
             where every thought and action aligns with our true nature.</p>
    <p>
        <br><em>
        Through this redefined prayer, we refine our choices, acting with purpose and discernment. 
        Secure in the knowledge that 'I', the true self  is bigger than every situation, 
        and will outlast every situation: we act without fear of failure.
        This understanding is not theoretical; 
        it transforms how we perceive, choose, relate, and live right here and now, in this moment.
        It is liberating. Vedanta does not introduce new ideas but guides us to uncover universal truth systematically, 
        directly, and with peace, tolerance, and joy.</p></em>
          
          
        

</p></em>
     <p> 
  Vedanta does not teach us new ideas; it shows us a way to discover what is a universal truth.<br> Systematically, Directly and best of 
         all with peace, tolerance and joy.<br> </p> 

        <p><em> A Three-Pronged Approach</em></p>
        
<p>Vedanta provides a structured method to uncover the Self through inquiry, not faith. 
    This method rests on three pillars, providing stability:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shravan (Listening): Approach teachings with openness and respect, absorbing what we see and hear without prejudice.</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan (Reflection: Test what we have observed and heard against our own experiences, making them personal and relevant.</li>
    <li>Manan (Examination): Analyze it for logical consistency, ensuring they withstand scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach transforms abstract concepts into lived understanding, guiding you to see the Self in every moment.</p>
        
  <p>
    This three-pronged approach provides stability to our conclusions. It must be clarified
      that observation does not necessarily preceed experience or analysis. <br>Mathematicians may analyse first and then 
      find their conclusions are indeed observable - example Einstein founded the theory of relitivity and subsequently Eddington 
      found that observations corroborate it. 
      <br> At other times, we experience something unique and later understand it and 
      learn to recognize it in others. 
      
     <br> Regardless of the order all three conditions 
      must be satisfied: observation ( direct or by others) , logical consistency and direct experience. 
      Like a three-legged table , this three pronged approach offers the greatest stability in realizing the truth—four legs might cause it to wobble, while fewer than three make it unstable.
  </p>

  <p>
  All that follows in this journey is part of step one.
      Steps two and three are yours alone. Two-thirds of this path must be walked by you.
  </p>

 
       
        
        <p> <em>Tools for this journey </em></p>

             <p>The path to self-knowledge requires tools— soecific qualities and executable practices that prepare you for inner discovery 
                 while fulfilling worldly responsibilities. These tools serve two purposes:<br>
Building Sustainable Systems: By cultivating skills like purposeful action, love, devotion, curiosity, 
                 and inquiry, you create strong, self-sustaining relationships and responsibilities. 
                 This frees you to focus on self-knowledge without neglecting your duties.<br>

Pursuing Self-Knowledge: These same qualities—clarity, compassion, and discipline—become the foundation for inner exploration. <br>

For example, combining action with reasoning in daily tasks. If in your work as a salesperson you learn that not all customer complaints are equal .One requires you to appease
                 the customer, the other requires you to notify 
                 the product team to modify the product. This ability to distinguishing between noise and signal,
                  sharpens your ability to  discern between impermanent and real, during self-inquiry. 
                 Vedanta teaches how to think, not what to think, empowering you to apply these tools uniquely to your life. </p>



         <p> <em>Vizualizing the journey </em>/p>
  <p>

     To illustrate progress toward freedom, I created a chart inspired by my professional background in understanding financial markets.
      The chart depicts the journey as a spiral, symbolizing iterative growth through self-inquiry. 
      Notably, it lacks a time axis, reflecting that freedom is found in the present moment, 
      not a distant future. 
      Contentment arises when no external force—time, space, or power—can disturb your inner peace.
The chart highlights:<br>
A Single Goal: Freedom.<br>

A Single Path: Self-knowledge.<br>

Multiple Tools: Purposeful action, love, devotion, curiosity, and inquiry, applied together to transform daily life.<br>

    <p>   Another powerful metaphor is a stereogram image, where a hidden 3D picture—a bowl shaped like a crown with a ball—emerges only with persistent, u
        unblinking focus. At first, the image is just a pattern of blue balls. 
        With patience, the balls seem to rise, and the hidden image becomes clear. 
        This mirrors the Self: always present, yet requiring steady attention to recognize. 
        Once seen, it’s unmistakable, transforming how you perceive the world.</p>

        <p> <em>Living the Discovery

 </em>
             </p> 

              <p> 
   Vedanta doesn’t deny emotions or circumstances. It shifts our perspective: we are more than the challenges we face. 
        Self-knowledge isn’t theoretical—it reshapes how you relate to the world. Every action becomes a prayer, e
        very choice a step toward freedom. By applying Vedanta’s tools and methodology, you don’t acquire something new; 
        you uncover what’s already true. This discovery is liberating, grounding you in the present and empowering you to live with purpose, clarity, and joy.

    <em style="color: white;">
            When we know we’ll emerge whole, stress fades. A crisis becomes a situation and the problem is reduced to one of temporary endurance. </em>
  </p>
<p> <em>The role of a Guru. </em>
             </p> 
    
<p>We are never  alone on our path. In Vedanta, the Guru is an indispensable guide—a 
    living embodiment of wisdom who helps us internalize the  truth first realized by the ancient Rishis, 
    the original seers. Rooted in direct experience, the Guru serves as both a mirror reflecting our potential 
    and a mentor guiding us toward truth.</p>
<p>The Munduka Upaniṣad ( 1:2:12) emphasizes the Guru’s vital role,
    stating: “तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत् समित्पाणिः श्रोत्रियं ब्रह्मनिष्ठम्”, meaning one must approach a Guru who is steeped in knowledge and firmly established in Brahman.
    <br>Adi Shankaracharya <a href="Shankra.html" class="vedanta-button">More about Shankara</a> equates the Guru with the divine, 
    proclaiming: “गुरुर्ब्रह्मा गुरुर्विष्णुः गुरुर्देवो महेश्वरः। गुरुः साक्षात् परब्रह्म तस्मै श्रीगुरवे नमः॥” — the Guru is none other than Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, and the Supreme Brahman itself.</p>
<p>Through such a Guru, the teachings of the Upanishads transform from mere words into a living, transformative experience.
 <br>   It is said that a Guru does not choose the student; rather, the student 
    chooses the Guru. So, who have I chosen? First, my parents—my mother and father—who are my co-learners. 
    We study independently and share insights through discussions. Next, Professor Steven Thompson, who spent decades studying in Pune.
    In 2011, despite my grueling 12-hour workdays, he taught me at my home every Wednesday from 9 PM to midnight. 
    Then, the internet, where I immersed myself in YouTube lectures, often listening just before bed. It is also a brilliant tool for Sandhi-viched -  the process of breaking apart Sanskrit compound words, m for uncovering the deep meanings of texts like the Gita and Upanishads. 
    While English translations often lose these nuances, exploring the original Sanskrit roots reveals their true essence, enriching my understanding.

<p><em style="color: white;">  The Truth</em></p>

 <p>With this introduction to why I chose Vedanta, you now have options:
You can explore foundational themes, or leap into the Gita. It’s like choosing between abstract art (The foundational themes explore universal truths) or figurative painting (Gita illustrates a live example of
     Vedanta
     ). Both are profound and analytical. The choice is yours.

Or you may choose another path. That’s valid too. <br>The Rigveda says in verse 1.164.46 <br>
     
          <em> "एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"     </em>  <br>
Ekam sad viprā bahudhā vadanti  <br>  <br> 
      Translated: Truth is one; the wise express it in many ways. <br>All traditions point to the same truth.
      <br>
   
          <br> Truth is a fundamental law which was, is and always will be.<br>Everwhere and in everything. 
      <br>It is the very reason for your existance, mine and that of everything in the entire universe.<br>  
      Eventually every one of us will realize the truth. When we do, the knowledge will set us free. 
      We won’t retreat from life—we’ll engage more fully, upholding justice, fairness, and compassion.

    </div>
      <br><em style="color: white;">The truth is that we are infinite, timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
      ... Vedant offers one path,not the only path, but a very direct path to this realisation.
