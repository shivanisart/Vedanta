        <em>Freedom</em><br>
   
        <em>What is my purpose?</em><br><br>

        No matter who we are—how accomplished, beautiful, wealthy, healthy, or loved—we all face moments when life feels heavy. 
        Times when problems overwhelm us, self-doubt creeps in, and everything seems on the verge of falling apart. 
        Our relationships feel fragile, our work uncertain, and the love or security we once felt begins to fade.

        <br>
        When life is smooth, I feel energized and inspired. I notice the sunshine, the blooming flowers;
        I plan dinners out and sketch five-year visions for my career.

        <br>
        But in moments like these—the hard ones—I start to question everything:
        <br>
        What is my purpose?<br>
        Why was I born?<br>
        What is the meaning of life?
<br><br>I began to explore multiple paths:    <br>  
   
        My search for answers has taken me through history, religion, science, art, and even the volatile world of financial markets. Each discipline offered some wisdom.
<br>History teaches you history (of course it does!).
<br>The purpose of science is to understand matter and our universe - the subject of science.
<br>But the purpose of Vedanta is not to understand the subject matter of Vedas or scriptures—
it is to gain mastery over the one who studies them: the Self.
To know the very core of our being—directly and immediately.

<br><br>The closest I’ve come to an experience 
that silences my restlessness while provoking deeper curiosity—
is through applying the methods of Vedanta to my own life.<br>
       Vedanta permits you to challenge every thing Vedanta says .<br> Indeed challenge is encouraged, and many of the texts 
        are in the form of a dialogue where the student consistantly, but respecfully queries and challenges the guru. Reading these, I find that 
        some of the questions that arisie in my mind have been raised before.
         
<br>

     
        <p>My motivation to explore Vedanta began in trying to understand myself in moments of despair. 
        But quickly, it became something more, a path I wanted to walk every day, everywhere, in everything I do.
So I decided to study the Upanishads...  <br>
To memorize the seven hundred shlokas of the Bhagavad Gita,<br>
    As an artist and someone with a corporate background my natural inclination is to express what I comprehend visually and graphically. <br><br>
 People ask why I want to memorize all seven hundred verses, “Isn’t understanding enough?” 
       <br> <br>Memorization deepens understanding. 
        It’s like having a perfectly organized mental filing system, 
        one where every verse is instantly accessible.<br>
        This ease of retrieval allows connections to emerge effortlessly and vividly. The text doesn’t just sit in books; 
        it lives within you, shaping thought and insight in real time. <br> 
      
     </p>
             <p>  <em>Moksha</em>  </p>
     <p>The goal of Vedanta is Moksha. The word Moksha comes from “mo,” meaning release, and “sha,” meaning state—so it’s the state of being truly free. 
         It’s freedom through self-realization, where you awaken to your core essence. 
         As humans, we’re born with this innate freedom, but life’s layers—possessions, relationships, thoughts—can tangle us in attachment. 
         These attachments bring joy but also chain us.

        <p>Image above: picasso quoute - learn to undraw </p>
    </div>
     
        <br>But here’s the paradox—
        How can freedom be a goal if we were born with and already have freedom? 
        It’s like saying, “My goal is to be a millionaire,” when your bank account already holds millions—
        The problem is that you just haven’t checked your account, so you don't know.
        

That’s exactly the point: 
        The goal needs to be more precise. 
        The problem is not the absence of freedom, but ignorance of it. 
        So the goal isn’t to gain freedom—it’s to gain the knowledge that we are already free - as we were born. 
        <br> Moksha is that unshakable peace, pure bliss, or anand that comes with the realization
         that we are already free. <br>In this realization, we learn to navigate worldly pursuits with detachment, aligning them with our deeper truth.

        <em>Vedanta</em><br>
        <em>What Vedanta is not</em>

        <br><br>
        Vedanta is not a religion, it is not a philosophy, 
        nor a belief system—and it certainly is not a concept.<br>
       Vedanta is about 'you' and you are not a concept or a philosophy. 
        Nor it it any use to "know" about Vedanta if you don't apply it to 
        your life. 

         
        <br> <br>
        
          The word <em>ved</em> itself means “knowledge”—not just any knowledge, but the most intimate kind: knowledge of the Self.
        Are there other paths to this discovery?
        Certainly, and Vedanta recognizes this, therefore is open to multiple and diverging viewpoints. But many paths are long and winding. Vedanta offers a direct one. 
        
          <br><br>
        <em>What Vedanta is </em>
<p>
Vedanta teaches that our true nature—the Self—is infinite, timeless, and ever-present. 
     You might think that knowing the Self should be simple—it’s what’s closest to us. 
    Yet, because it’s always with us, we often overlook it, like missing the forest for the trees. 
    Vedanta offers more than abstract ideas; it provides a practical process to discover the Self and achieve freedom.
    Sankhya Yoga, derived from "Sam" meaning complete, "khya" meaning evalation/explaination and "Yoga" meaning union, is the path to liberation.
    It achieves freedom by uniting the self and 
    the infinite through self evaluation and insight.
    It transforms how we think, choose, and live.
Freedom in Vedanta isn’t about escaping life’s challenges but living with clarity and contentment, unshaken by external forces like time or circumstance.
    You’re not bound by rigid rules or dogma—you’re free to choose at every step. 
    But choices matter: missteps may lead to confusion or suffering, while aligned actions guide you toward the truth you already are.

       <p><em>Uninterrupted Pursuit <br> Methodology</em></p>

        <p>Image above: All day. Everyday. this is an image of a repeated action</p>
    </div>
  <p><em>The promise of Vedanta comes with an ask</em></p> 
        <p>
  
  The Self is ever present; it’s not something we schedule.  
  It’s in every action, every thought, all day, every day. 

    That is why self knowledge is a process that asks for uninterrupted attention to reveal what is everpresent and already true.
It is not about acquiring new ideas; it is about discovery.<br> This recognition isn’t a one-time event but a way of life in which
            every action, every thought, becomes a prayer.
        <br><em>A prayer where every thought, every action becomes a converstion, not with a distant god,
        but with the infinite within yourself so that you refine your actions, think about them and act with purpose and discernment,
            You are not afraid to fail, secure in the 
            knowledge that you are bigger than every situation.<br>
            When this understanding dawns, it’s not theoretical.
It transforms how we perceive the world, how we choose, relate, and live—right here, in this moment. It is liberating.

</p></em>

        <p><em> A Three-Pronged Approach</em></p>
        
<p>Vedanta provides a structured method to uncover the Self through inquiry, not faith. 
    This method rests on three pillars, providing stability:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Shravan (Listening): Approach teachings with openness and respect, absorbing their wisdom without prejudice.</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan (Reflection: Test these teachings against your own experiences, making them personal and relevant.</li>
    <li>Manan (Examination): Analyze the teachings for logical consistency, ensuring they withstand scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach transforms abstract concepts into lived understanding, guiding you to see the Self in every moment.</p>
        
  <p>
    This three-pronged approach provides stability to our conclusions. Like a three-legged table offers the greatest stability—four legs might cause it to wobble, while fewer than three make it unstable.
  </p>

  <p>
  All that follows in this journey is part of step one.
      Steps two and three are yours alone. Two-thirds of this path must be walked by you.
  </p>

 
       
        
        <p> <em>Tools for this journey </em>/p>

             <p>The path to self-knowledge requires tools—qualities and practices that prepare you for inner discovery 
                 while fulfilling worldly responsibilities. These tools serve two purposes:<br>
Building Sustainable Systems: By cultivating skills like purposeful action, love, devotion, curiosity, 
                 and inquiry, you create strong, self-sustaining relationships and responsibilities. 
                 This frees you to focus on self-knowledge without neglecting your duties.<br>

Pursuing Self-Knowledge: These same qualities—clarity, compassion, and discipline—become the foundation for inner exploration. <br>

For example, combining action with reasoning in daily tasks (parenting or work) builds resilience in distinguishing between noise and signal,
                 while the same intentionality sharpens your ability to distinguish between impermanent and real, during self-inquiry. 
                 Vedanta teaches how to think, not what to think, empowering you to apply these tools uniquely to your life. </p>



         <p> <em>Vizualizing the journey </em>/p>
  <p>

     To illustrate progress toward freedom, I created a chart inspired by my professional background in understanding financial markets.
      The chart depicts the journey as a spiral, symbolizing iterative growth through self-inquiry. 
      Notably, it lacks a time axis, reflecting that freedom is found in the present moment, 
      not a distant future. 
      Contentment arises when no external force—time, space, or power—can disturb your inner peace.
The chart highlights:<br>
A Single Goal: Freedom.<br>

A Single Path: Self-knowledge.<br>

Multiple Tools: Purposeful action, love, devotion, curiosity, and inquiry, applied together to transform daily life.<br>

    <p>   Another powerful metaphor is a stereogram image, where a hidden 3D picture—a bowl shaped like a crown with a ball—emerges only with persistent, u
        nblinking focus. At first, the image is just a pattern of blue balls. 
        With patience, the balls seem to rise, and the hidden image becomes clear. 
        This mirrors the Self: always present, yet requiring steady attention to recognize. 
        Once seen, it’s unmistakable, transforming how you perceive the world.</p>

        <p> <em>Living the Discovery

 </em>
             </p> 

              <p> 
   Vedanta doesn’t deny emotions or circumstances. It shifts our perspective: we are more than the challenges we face. 
        Self-knowledge isn’t theoretical—it reshapes how you relate to the world. Every action becomes a prayer, e
        very choice a step toward freedom. By applying Vedanta’s tools and methodology, you don’t acquire something new; 
        you uncover what’s already true. This discovery is liberating, grounding you in the present and empowering you to live with purpose, clarity, and joy.

<p> <em>The role of a Guru. </em>
             </p> 
    
<p> 
We are not left alone. 
    In Vedanta, the Guru is indispensable—a living guide who helps us internalize the revelations 
    first seen by the ancient Rishis, the original seers.
    The Guru, rooted in direct realization, is both mirror and mentor on the path to truth.
    Adi Shanrachaeya <a href="Shankra.html" class="vedanta-button"> More about Shankra</a>
    places the Guru 
    firmly at par with none other than 
    Bramhan: “गुरुर्ब्रह्मा गुरुर्विष्णुः गुरुर्देवो महेश्वरः। गुरुः साक्षात् परब्रह्म तस्मै श्रीगुरवे नमः॥” —
    the Guru is none other than Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, and the Supreme Brahman.
    The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad affirms: “तद्विज्ञानार्थं स गुरुमेवाभिगच्छेत् समित्पाणिः श्रोत्रियं ब्रह्मनिष्ठम्”, 
    one must approach a Guru who is rooted in knowledge and established in Brahman.
    It is through such a Guru that the teachings of the 
    Upanishads become a living, transformative experience.

<em style="color: white;">  The Truth</em>

 <p>With this introduction to why I chose Vedanta, you now have options:
You can explore foundational themes, or leap into the Gita. It’s like choosing between abstract art (universal truths) or figurative painting (life examples). Both are profound and analytical. The choice is yours.

Or you may choose another path. That’s valid too. <br>The Rigveda says in verse 1.164.46 <br>
     
          <em> "एकं सद्विप्रा बहुधा वदन्ति"     </em>  <br>
Ekam sad viprā bahudhā vadanti  <br>  <br> 
      Translated: Truth is one; the wise express it in many ways. <br>All traditions point to the same truth.
      <br>
   
          <br> Truth is a fundamental law which was, is and always will be.<br>Everwhere and in everything. 
      <br>It is the very reason for your existance, mine and that of everything in the entire universe.<br>  
      Eventually every one of us will realize the truth. When we do, the knowledge will set us free. 
      We won’t retreat from life—we’ll engage more fully, upholding justice, fairness, and compassion.

      <br><em style="color: white;">The truth is that we are infinite, timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
      ... Vedant offers one path,not the only path, but a very direct path to this realisation.
