       <p><em> Truth and beauty: An artist's exploration</em></p>
  <h1>Below is a talk at Central Saint martins on 13/4/2021
      
      Good Evening, Everyone</h1>
    <p>My name is Shivani Mathur. I am an artist pursuing art and science at Central Saint Martins. We at Central Saint Martins are very trendy people. Lockdown has brought in some brand new trends:
    - Attending lectures from my bathtub. Of course, speaker mute and camera off!
    - I’ve learned a completely new language... I’ve learned that you can turn beautiful by investing a small fortune of £20 in a ring light.
    But most of all, lockdown has taught me how little I really need to live well and be happy. I don’t need designer handbags, I don’t eat in expensive restaurants, I don’t spend a small fortune on black cabs...</p>

    <p>Do you know that today, there are <ul><li>139 million artificial objects flying around in space—mostly useless junk in space?</li><li>47 percent of all email on the internet is spam. Again, mostly junk on the internet in addition to junk in space.</li><li>And are you ready for the most outrageous statistic? The attention span of people on average is just 6 seconds.</li></ul>So if you don’t capture their attention immediately—boom, they’re gone. The question I ask myself—why is space full of stuff, the internet full of stuff, our minds and our homes full of stuff? Do we really need this “stuff”?</p>

    <p>And in this world full of stuff, should I as an artist add to the clutter in the name of beauty? What is beauty anyway?</p>

    <p>My investigation took me to study subjects as varied as science, history, the financial crisis of 2008, and the philosophy from the Upanishads.</p>

    <p>In 1928, a mathematician by the name of Paul Dirac was playing around with some equations and he made a startling discovery. Empty space is not empty. Now Dirac couldn’t prove it, but he took the view that if there is beauty in a mathematical equation, it must be right. He was right. Yet, in 2008, the opposite was true. The world saw one of the worst financial crises.</p>

    <p>I was a trader in a large investment bank and an economist by the name of Paul Krugman observed that the crisis happened because banks had made beautiful mathematical predictive models, and then they were so carried away that they mistook beauty for reality. They just never stopped for a moment to think how can this beautiful and perfect model possibly predict anything but the truth. Sadly, big institutions were brought to their knees. People lost their jobs. They lost their earnings of a lifetime. It wasn’t just a financial crisis. It was a human one. But both Paul Dirac and Paul Krugman were right.</p>

    <p>For centuries, mankind has been in search of beauty, symmetry as a proxy for truth and reality.</p>

    
     <p><em> Truth is beauty: but beauty is not always truth</em></p>
 
<p>The problem you see is also that while beauty may point to truth, what is not very clear is what is beauty?</p>
    <p>In 1886, when the Eiffel Tower was commissioned, there was a petition filed by the citizens of Paris.</p>

    <p>So with these thoughts on beauty revolving in my head, I took a walk in Hyde Park.</p>

    <p>It was the 11th of January. It was a beautiful day and I saw a poppy nodding defiantly in the breeze. And I tilted my head to look at it from different angles, it looked more and more beautiful to me. A startling thought struck me.</p>

    <p>Can beauty lie, not in what we look at, but in the act of changing our perspective itself?</p>

    <p>How can I change my perspective? And the echo came in my head. Dialogue, dialogue, dialogue. Can a dialogue itself be art?</p>

    <p>To explore this thought, during lockdown, I began a series of dialogues and I will share two of them with you.</p>

    <p>The first dialogue is on impermanence. If art is creating beauty, shot in London and at the cremation ghats of Benares, the first reflects on the impermanence of beauty. In it, you will see my beautiful paintings bundled with rubbish, cremated in the ghats of Benares and dissolve into eternity.</p>

    <p>The next dialogue is called “The Currency of Inspiration.”</p>

    <p>I will share one more dialogue with you—</p>

    <p>The word art derives from the Latin word for "skill method" or "technique," also conveys a connotation of beauty. I recorded nearly 30 dialogues in an 8-week period and each one is unique and rich. In my dialogues, I asked people what is their idea of something beautiful. These are some of the responses: kind, gentle, content, unique, makes me think of a brand new thought, stimulating.</p>

    <p>If art is beauty and this is what beauty is, then let’s fill the world with artists.</p>

 <em>  <p>Am I already the artwork I seek to create?</p></em>
