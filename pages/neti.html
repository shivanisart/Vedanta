 <em>Neti Neti </em>    </p> 
   <p> Purity is defined not by a test of presence, but that of absence. For example, water is pure when there is an absence of minerals in it. <br> 
   In Vedanta, this same princile of removing external elements is used to realize the pure , true "self"<br>
     It is called neti neti - Not this, not this. from "na" (not), and "iti" (this).<br>
     We strip away temporary layers which, we mistakenly assume to be the self  - such as our body, mind, ego... These decay over time. Only the pre self , the Atman remains.
     For the process of Neti Neti to be effective two conditions must be satisfied - <br>
     That which we seek ( here the Atman) must be in our sphere of reach. This is the case. Indeed, the Atman is us. 
     Second, 
<p><em>Arundhati Nyaya as a live example of Neti Neti </em></p>
      The Arundhati Nyaya, or Arundhati Darshan Nyaya, is a teaching method that reveals complex truths by moving from the obvious to the subtle, like spotting the faint Arundhati star in the Saptarishi constellation by first locating the brighter Vashishtha star nearby. Arundhati, Sage Vashishtha’s wife, symbolizes the ideal of devotion and fidelity, and her star’s faintness requires this step-by-step approach—pointing to brighter stars first, then guiding to her subtle light, a process called Arundhati Darshan Nyaya in Sanskrit, meaning inferring the unknown from the known. In Advaita Vedanta, this method, often linked to later scholars like Vachaspati Mishra in texts like the Bhamati, became a key way to understand profound concepts. In today’s world, it’s like building a complex product or business: start with what’s familiar, take clear steps, and as you reach each milestone, the next path reveals itself, guiding you forward until the goal is clear.
        <p><em> A Three-Pronged Approach</em></p>
        
<p>Vedanta provides a structured method to uncover the Self through inquiry, not faith. so how do we know nei, neti. Let us take two real examples. <br>

  
</p>
    
  <p><ul>
     We put or question through 3 tests to distinguish the temporary from the permanent: 

    <ul>
    <li>Shravan ( Listening and observation): Approach teachings with openness and respect, absorbing what we see and hear without prejudice.</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan (Reflection: Test what we have observed and heard against our own experiences, making them personal and relevant.</li>
    <li>Manan (Examination): Analyze it for logical consistency, ensuring they withstand scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
 </p>


    Example 1: Is the sky blue? Let us for a moment assume that we know nothing about refraction of light, so we . 


     
    <p>
<ul>
    <li>Shravan (Listenig /observation): Result: Pass. We are told in stories it is blue and direct observation shows its blue.</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan (Reflection and experience): Result: Pass. It feels like it is....</li>
    <li>Manan (Examination):  Result: Fail. On examination we find that logically, the sky is not blue at night, so blueness is the result of some external 
      factor, not the sky.</li>
</ul>
    Result: Fail. All three conditions not satisfied.
</p>
    <p>


       Example 2: Is the air inside an open pot same as the air outside?</p>


     
    <p>
<ul>
    <li>Shravan (observation): Result: Pass. We can see it is</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan (Reflection and experience): Result: Pass. It feels like it is ....</li>
    <li>Manan (Examination):  Result: If we break the pot the air is indistinguisible. so it must be the same.</li>
</ul>
    
    Result: Pass. All three conditions satisfied. </p>
    <p>
      Example 3:Is the body our unchanging self?
<ul>
    <li>Shravan (observation): Result: Fail. When we get a haircut, we look different. When we age we look different. Yet we are recognized.</li>
    <li>Nididhyasan (Reflection and experience): Result: Pass. It feels like it....</li>
    <li>Manan (Examination):  Result: Fail. The body dies, It is clearly impermanent.</li>
</ul>
    
   Result: Fail. All three conditions not satisfied. </p>
    
<p>This approach transforms abstract concepts into lived understanding, So , lets test go through the three test</p>

        
  <p>
    This three-pronged approach provides stability to our conclusions. It must be clarified
      that observation does not necessarily preceed experience or analysis. <br>Mathematicians may analyse first and then 
      find their conclusions are indeed observable - example Einstein founded the theory of relitivity and subsequently Eddington 
      found that observations corroborate it. 
      <br> At other times, we experience something unique and later understand it and 
      learn to recognize it in others. 
      
     <br> Regardless of the order all three conditions 
      must be satisfied: observation ( direct or by others) , logical consistency and direct experience. 
      Like a three-legged table , this three pronged approach offers the greatest stability in realizing the truth—four legs might cause it to wobble, while fewer than three make it unstable.
  </p>

  <p>
  All that follows in this journey is part of step one.
      Steps two and three are yours alone. Two-thirds of this path must be walked by you.
  </p>Examples:
     When you look at the sky, you see a vast blue expanse, You know from your study of science that the sky is not blue - it is the refraction of light. Yet you experience a blue sky. 
     Knowledge permits you to discount an experience as "unreal" This is because all three condirions are not satisfied
