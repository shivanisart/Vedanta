      <br><br><em>  The ancient Rishis</em> 
    <br> In ancient India, 6,000 to 10,000 years ago there existed sages called Rishis (those who see). 
    These Rishis were untaught. Their meditative practices included observation, reasoning and contemplation. Some of the Rishis were monks,  
    leading the life of an ascetic, contemplating in the Himalayas. Others were firmly embedded in society, had families, some were indeed even warriors. 
    <br> Whatever their background, they all had one thing in common. They were seekers of "truth". 
    These Rishis 'heard' from a divine source and had 'visions' which they subsequently verified against their own experiences and reasoning.  
    They passed down the content of this knowledge which they experienced by way of an oral tradition.
    Over time their observations, experiences and inferences were documented in the Vedas. 
    That is why the Vedas are also called Shruti - that which is heard. 
    <br> Indeed, it is said that the Rishis are not the origin of the wisdom in the Vedas. They are the vessels. 

    <br>    <br>
      <em> Shruti - The Reveealed texts </em>     <br>    <br>
      
      There are four Vedas. 
    <br>Each of the four Vedas, The Rig Veda, Samaveds, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.    <br>
     Each of the Vedas  is divided into four parts. The first three sections, together called the Karma kand deal with our action and worldly affairs. Samhitas are hymns. Bramhana deal with rituals, Aranyakas focus on  meditations. worldly life—guidance on justice, social harmony, agriculture, compassion, and the pursuit of material success. 

    The fourth section in each Veda stands apart. These are the Upanishads —collectively known as Vedanta. 
    "Veda" means knowledge, and "Anta" means end. Vedanta is the culmination—the highest knowledge.

    Though Vedanta transcends worldly concerns, it deeply influences how we live. It transforms our inner lens, which in turn reshapes our actions. 
    When we understand the Self, our choices begin to reflect clarity, compassion, and true freedom.

    Across the four Vedas, there are 108 Upanishads  - The focus of all of them is singular. <br>

      <section>
  <h2><em> Mahavakyas. </em> /h2>

  <p>
  Mahavakyas are statements that encapsulate the essence of Vedant, briefly and efficiently.  
  But they need to be unpacked to understand. Most Mahavakyas have three components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tat = "That" = the Infinite = Brahman</li>
  <li>Enam/Idam</Aham = "This" = the Self = Atman</li>
  <li>A connector verb (such as "is" or "are")</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The realization? The self and the infinite are one and the same.
</p>

<p> Example:
  <em>Tat Tvam Asi</em><br>
 From the Chandogya Upanishad<br>
  Chapter 6, Verses 8.8–15<br><br>

  You are that<br>
  You are <s>that</s> the Infinite<br>
  You are <s>the Infinite</s> Brahman<br><br>

  The words are simple, but the implications are far-reaching.  
  And when we begin to comprehend how far-reaching this is—how it touches our daily lives, our attitudes, actions, and experiences—it becomes deeply empowering.
</p>


  <p>
    Because if:<br>
    <em>“The essence that gives <em>this Self</em>—you, me, any of us—life is the same infinite power that animates the entire cosmos.”</em><br>
    Then:<br>
    <em>The power and potential that created the entire universe lies within us.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
    That is why there are 108 Upanishads explaining this truth in countless ways, using different metaphors and stories.<br>
    Though they were written in different styles and eras, all 108 Upanishads point to one central insight:<br><br>
  This is That<br>
   The Self is Infinite
  </p>

  <p>
    Statements that connect the core of our being to the Infinite are called Mahavakyas.<br>
    The images below depict four such Mahavakyas—each drawn from one of the four Vedas.

  <p>
    If we are infinite, then why is there pain and inadequacy in the first place?
  </p>

  <br><br>
<section>
  <p><em>Lifting the veil</em></p>

  <p>
    Vedanta says it’s because we are unaware of this power within us.
    Earlier we made an analogy of missing the forest for the trees.
    Vedanta also cites another example: that of the musk deer that roamed the Himalayas:
  </p>

  <p>The Fragrance You Are</p>

  <p>
    The musk deer wandered, lost in trance,<br>
    Chasing scent like a sacred dance.<br>
    A hint of love, a holy sign—<br>
    A fragrance soft, almost divine.<br><br>

    It searched through valleys, peaks, and mist,<br>
    Believing bliss was just next twist.<br>
    But step by step, and breath by breath,<br>
    It chased that scent until its death.<br><br>

    It never saw. How could it know?<br>
    The source was in it, all aglow.<br>
    That love it chased, that sacred spark,<br>
    Was always burning in its heart.
  </p>

  <p><em>Three examples of the veil</em> </p>

  <p>
    The Three Veils (<em>Āvaraṇas</em>) in the Gita:
    As fire is covered by smoke, a mirror by dust, and an embryo is constricted in the womb,
    so is knowledge covered by this (this = desire to abandon your duty under the veil of compassion).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
   Smoke and fire: When smoke veils a fire, the fire has not yet died.
      Momentarily obscured, it can be fanned back to life with relative ease.
      In the same way, desire (kāma), attraction (rāga) and avoidance (dveṣa)
      can be dispelled through self-effort, devotion, and inquiry.
     [Gita 3.39, 4.42, 5.11, 6.25, 18.30]
    </li>

    <li>
     Dust covering a mirror: Requires a little more effort to uncover.
      When truth is obscured, uninterrupted effort (sādhana), study, and self-discipline are needed.
     [Gita 4.38, 6.5, 5.27–28, 13.11, 14.11]
    </li>

    <li>
      Embryo constrained in the womb:hen deep-rooted and unconscious conditioning veils the truth,
      only time, maturation, and patience will resolve the conflict.
     [Gita 2.13, 4.34, 7.19, 15.11, 18.66]
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each veil corresponds to a phase of spiritual maturity,
    and Krishna offers not only diagnosis, but a path forward —
    through <em>karma yoga</em>, <em>jñāna yoga</em>, and <em>bhakti yoga</em> respectively.
  </p>

 <br> <br>Vedanta is often associated with wisdom acquired by those who’ve turned away from material life. But that’s a narrow view. 
      The Rishis were not passive recipients of wisdom. They discovered truths through reflection, reasoning, and direct experience. Observing the constant change in the world—birth, decay, death—they uncovered something deeper beneath it all: a timeless, unchanging reality called Brahman.
 This insight wasn’t just philosophical. It changed how they engaged with the world. It brought freedom from fear, clarity in decision-making, and compassion in action.


 <br>Vedanta doesn’t ask us to retreat from life—it shows us that as we navigate our lives, we must strive for justice , fairnesss and compassion. Even in our pursuit of worldly values, most importantly, we must never lose sight of the truth - that ultimately we are Brahman- timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
      This is where the <a href="gita.html">Bhagwad Gita</a> comes in—because it applies the highest teaching of Vedanta to the life of someone who is firmly embedded in the material world: a family of squabbling kings. 

   <br> Before we fastrack to the Gita, it is worthwhile understanding of some of the very fundamental lines of thought in Vedant and some definitions..  
            <br>  <br>  Core Concepts: 
  </p>
            <br><br>

<p> <em> What is truth? Sat vs Mithya. </em> 
        <br><br>
  What is “real”? Is it what you can measure with your senses? the weather, your thoughts, feelings, dreams, memories—even hallucinations? All of these seem real while they last.
  <br><br>
  Vedanta affirms: everything we experience is real. The ancient Rishis, or seers, recognized that every experience holds truth—but they asked:
  <br><br>
  Is there something that remains unchanged amidst all change?
  <br><br>
  They saw that the body ages, the mind fluctuates, and the world evolves. Yet, beneath it all, they discovered an unchanging essence—Brahman.
  <br><br>
  Shankaracharya, described this true reality (Sat) as <em>Trikāla Abādhitam</em>: that which remains constant through past, present, and future.
  <br><br>
  This insight didn’t come from belief, but from direct self-inquiry. It is not theoretical—it is transformative. That unchanging Self is our true nature.
  <br><br>
  Everything else is apparently real (Mithya). Often misunderstood as “false,” Mithya isn’t unreal—it’s just impermanent, ever-shifting: the material world.
  This distinction between Sat and Mithya is further clarified as we explore the meaning of Atman, Bramhan and the different levels of reality we experience. 
  A very detailed understanding of the distinction between Sat and Mithya is explored in the <a href="mandukya.html">Mandukya Upanishad</a>. The Mandukya Upanishad, the shortest Upanishad, is only 12 verses long. 
  Yet, it is one of the most profound. 
</p>    <br><br>
<p> <em> Atmn and Bramhan. </em>
        <br><br>

         <p>
      Building on this understanding, the Rishis looked deeper. Beneath the ever-shifting layers of body and mind, they recognized a continuous presence—unchanging and ever-aware. They named this essence <strong>Atman</strong>, the individual Self.
      <br><br>
      Atman is not separate from us—it is our true nature. To illustrate, imagine a room filled with pots. Each pot, like our mind and body, contains air, symbolic of our Atman. While the pots may differ in shape or size, the air within them is not different from the air in other pots, no indeed from air in the room. Likewise, <strong>Atman</strong> in each of us is not distinct from <strong>Brahman</strong>, the infinite.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Brahman is Sat</strong>—unchanging, eternal, and unborn. All that shifts and changes belongs to the realm of Mithya. We are not merely the body or the mind; we are that constant, indivisible presence. We are Atman—and Atman is Brahman.
         Brahman , the sanskrit word comes from the root BRH - which means to grow, expand swell. Brahman is the "ever expanding reality", infinite. It exists beyond all limits of time and space and human conception. 
        Atman, the sanskrit word is a composite of "a"+ "tmaan" "A" is a prefix that means towards or into, Tman" is to expand. So atman is the inward expansion of bramhan- "the self" which is not distinct from Bramhan.
    </p>

          <br><br>
<p> <em> Levels of reality. </em>    </p>
        <br><br>
<p>
  Having understood that Atman is Brahman—the unchanging essence within us—Vedanta guides us through the various layers of our experience. These are the levels of reality through which we live. Some are temporary; others are permanent.
  <br><br>
  This is the subject matter of the Mandukya Upanishad, which describes these states using the metaphor of a dreamer passing through waking life, dreams, and deep sleep. In brief, we all experience these three impermanent realities, one at a time. All the while, the fourth—the ultimate reality, true, conscious, and eternal—coexists in every state.
  <br><br>
  These three realities are:
  <br><br>
  1. Sthoola Shareera – The reality of our physical existence: the gross body, ruled by the senses and driven by pleasure, pain, and survival.
  <br><br>
  2. Sukshma Shareera – The realm of our thoughts, emotions, desires, and intellect—ever-changing and reactive. What we might today call our "mindspace."
  <br><br>
  3. Sushupti – The causal state: a quiet, unmanifest dimension full of latent potential. Carl Jung called it the collective unconscious. It is that part of our being not yet visible, but with the power to shape future outcomes. Think of it as a flower bud waiting to bloom—or past actions yet to fructify.
  <br><br>
  These three levels of reality belong to the material world.
  <br><br>
  4. Atman – The Self: the silent witness behind all states—unchanging, untouched, eternal.
  <br><br>
  Vedanta affirms that none of the three material realities exist independently of Atman. Using the metaphor of the ocean, these realities are like waves—rising and falling, creating shapes and movements. But no wave exists without water—our Atman. And every droplet of water in the ocean (Brahman) is interchangeable.
  <br><br>
  We must recognize that the exhilaration we experience as a wave is temporary—it collapses back into the water. And the water droplet is the ocean. We are not the wave, but the water—and indeed, not different from the vast ocean itself.
  <br><br>
  This realization dawns differently for each of us. That’s why Vedanta emphasizes tolerance—in two distinct ways: tolerance for the perspectives of others, because they ride different waves and see differently; and tolerance for the crests and troughs we ourselves pass through. Though our paths vary, we are all journeying toward the same truth—from many forms, through many states, toward the One.
</p>
  <br><br>
        <p> <em> Another analogy: The computer </em>
    </p>
                  <br><br>

            <p>
  Think of yourself like a computer. Your brain is the hardware. 
                Your thoughts and emotions are the software. But you—the real you—are the electricity. 
                The hardware might break. The software may crash. But the electricity remains untouched. 
                You are not the program. You are not the machine. You are the power that makes it run.
</p>
  <br><br>
        
        <p> <em> Another analogy: The computer </em>
    </p>

         <br><br>
        <p> <em> The same quest: modern Science and Vedanta</em>
    </p>
        <p>
  Modern science shares its quest with Vedanta . 
            Quantum physics tells us matter is not solid—it’s mostly empty space. 
            Particles appear and disappear in and out of existance in empty space. 
            Observation affects reality. Particles that are entangled communicate with each other mysteriously.
            Science asks: What is empty space ? How does the universe work at subobservavable scales?<br>
            Vedanta draws a distinction between observation limited to senory stimuli and observation that is experiential. 
            It asks: Can we realize what we are experiencing even when it is not directly visible 
            through our senses through a rigourous process of reasoning, listening and experience?
