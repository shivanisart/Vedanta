      <em>Moksha</em>
        <p>Moksha, the goal of all teachings of the Vedas, is liberation. A state of absoloute freedom from bondage, suffering when we realize in our current life 
        that we are are infinite, immortal and everpresent.</p>
        <em>Three words</em>

    <p>
        They say this essence, of all the Vedas can be distilled into just three words:

        <br><br>
        <strong><em>Tat Tvam Asi</em></strong> <br>
       Chandogya Upanishad, Chapter 6, Verses 8.8–15

        <br><br>
        <strong>Translated:</strong> You are that.

        <br><br>
        What does it mean?<br>
        The words are simple; the implications, profound. The first time you hear it, you are clueless as to what it means. That's okay.
        The true test is: Will understanding this statement take us to our goal? Will it set us free?
          <br><br>
         Vedant says Yes - It will.<br>
        Lets unpacked this statement. It has three components:<br>
        </p>

<ul>
  <li>Tat = "That" = the Infinite = Brahman</li>
  <li>Twam = "You" = the Self = Atman</li>
  <li>A connector verb = "are"</li>
</ul>

<p>
  That you are <br> or<br>
</p>

<p>  You are that<br>
  You are <s>that</s> the Infinite<br>
  You are <s>the Infinite</s> Brahman<br><br>

  The words are simple, but the implications are far-reaching.  It tells us that the essence of who with are is identicle to the essence of everything in the universe.

</p>


  <p>
    Far reaching because if:<br>
    <em>“The essence that gives <em>this Self</em>—you, me, any of us—life is the same infinite power that animates the entire cosmos.”</em><br>
    Then:<br>
    <em>The power and potential that created the entire universe lies within us.</em> <br> The key though, is not just to understand it, but infact align our lives, our behaviour and our whole being woth this understanding.
 When we begin to comprehend how far-reaching this is—how it touches our daily lives, our attitudes, actions, and experiences—it becomes deeply empowering

           represents my birth from  the same infinite power (tat) that animates the entire cosmos.</p>

  <em> Mahavakyas</em>

  <p>
  Mahavakyas, like the statement above, "Tat twam asi", encapsulate the essence of Vedant, briefly and efficiently.  All of them have
      the same three components telling us: <br>
      This self is infinite





  <p>
    To really comprehend the implications,there are 108 Upanishads explaining this truth in countless ways, using different metaphors and stories.<br>
    Though they were written in different styles and eras, all 108 Upanishads point to one central insight:<br><br>

   The Self is Infinite
  </p>

  <p>

    The images below depict four such Mahavakyas—each drawn from one of the four Vedas.

      <p>The Mahavakyas proclaim we are infinite—right now, always have been, always will be. This knowledge frees us from insecurities and fears. Freedom doesn’t come from beliefs; it comes from knowing.</p>
<p>Knowledge dismantles the misconceptions that cause our suffering. The Mahavakyas specially attack the false idea that we’re limited. They say, “No, you are <em>That</em>—unlimited, timeless, eternal.”</p>
<p>When we’re insecure, we build walls, claim territories, divide mine from yours. We chase, conquer, hoard. But what if we truly knew that everything we desire, we already have and always will?<br>
    Our outlook, our relationships, our entire way of living would transform. We’d be free in this very life—not chasing some prize after death.
    The heaven we seek is here, now.</p>
<p>This is the heart of Vedanta, revealed by the ancient Rishis and enshrined in the Vedas.</p>

       <section>

    <em> Background  <br><br>The ancient Rishis</em>
    <br> In ancient India, 6,000 to 10,000 years ago there existed sages called Rishis (those who see).
    These Rishis were untaught. Their meditative practices included observation, reasoning and contemplation. Some of the Rishis were monks,
    leading the life of an ascetic, contemplating in the Himalayas. Others were firmly embedded in society, had families, some were indeed even warriors.
    <br> Whatever their background, they all had one thing in common. They were seekers of "truth".
    These Rishis 'heard' from a divine source and had 'visions' which they subsequently verified against their own experiences and reasoning.
    They passed down the content of this knowledge which they experienced by way of an oral tradition.
    Over time their observations, experiences and inferences were documented in the Vedas.
    That is why the Vedas are also called Shruti - that which is heard.
    <br> Indeed, it is said that the Rishis are not the origin of the wisdom in the Vedas. They are the vessels.

    <br>    <br>

      <em> Shruti - The Revealed texts </em>     <br>    <br>

      Vedas are constitution of fundamental laws of the universe. It is said that the source of the Vedas is fundamental truth, not drafted by any human. There are four Vedas.
    <br>The Rig Veda, Samaveds, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.    <br>
     Each of the Vedas  is divided into four parts. The first three sections, together called the Karma kand deal with our action and worldly affairs.
        Samhitas are hymns.
        Bramhana deal with rituals,
        Aranyakas focus on  meditations. worldly life—guidance on justice, social harmony, agriculture, compassion, and the pursuit of material success.
        <br> In my study, my focus is not on the Karma Kand.
        That is not because it is any less, indeed
        the rituals and teachings are preparatory instructions
        to navigate culture and society with ease, and teach us
        discipline and technique. However,
        technique, excellence and ease of living are ultimately  are useful only to live comfortably.
    -  they dont set us free.
        <br> <br>

    Freedom is the subject matter of the fourth section in each Veda. These chapters are the Upanishads —collectively known as Vedanta.
    "Veda" means knowledge, and "Anta" means end. Vedanta is the culmination—the highest knowledge.

    Though Vedanta transcends worldly concerns, it deeply influences how we live. It transforms our inner lens, which in turn reshapes our actions.
    When we understand the Self, our choices begin to reflect clarity, compassion, and true freedom.

    Across the four Vedas, there are 108 Upanishads  - The focus of all of them is singular. <br> Freedom. in Vedantic language it is called Moksha.

 <p> <em> Foundation themes and definitions </em>

 <br> <br>Vedanta is often associated with wisdom acquired by those who’ve turned away from material life. But that’s a narrow view.
      The Rishis were not passive recipients of wisdom. They discovered truths through reflection, reasoning, and direct experience. Observing the constant change in the world—birth, decay, death—they uncovered something deeper beneath it all: a timeless, unchanging reality called Brahman.
 This insight wasn’t just philosophical. It changed how they engaged with the world. It brought freedom from fear, clarity in decision-making, and compassion in action.


 <br>Vedanta doesn’t ask us to retreat from life—it shows us that as we navigate our lives, we must strive for justice , fairnesss and compassion. Even in our pursuit of worldly values, most importantly, we must never lose sight of the truth - that ultimately we are Brahman- timeless and interconnected with the entire universe.
      This is where the <a href="gita.html">Bhagwad Gita</a> comes in—because it applies the highest teaching of Vedanta to the life of someone who is firmly embedded in the material world: a family of squabbling kings.

   <br> Before we fastrack to the Gita, it is worthwhile understanding of some of the very fundamental lines of thought in Vedant and some definitions..
            <br>  <br>
     <em> Truth.</em>
  </p>

<p>
  What is “real”? Is it what you can measure with your senses? the weather, your thoughts, feelings, dreams, memories—even hallucinations? All of these seem real while they last.

    </div> 
  Vedanta affirms: everything we experience is real. The ancient Rishis, or seers, recognized that every experience holds truth—but they asked:
  <br><br>
  Is there something that remains unchanged amidst all change?
  <br><br>
  They saw that the body ages, the mind fluctuates, and the world evolves. Yet, beneath it all, they discovered an unchanging essence—Brahman.
  <br><br>
  Shankaracharya, described this true reality (Sat) as <em>Trikāla Abādhitam</em>: that which remains constant through time, space and object. It exists in every time scale: past, present, and future.<br>
    It pervades beyond space and it exists in every form, every object.
  <br><br>

  Everything else is apparently real (Mithya). Often misunderstood as “false,” Mithya isn’t unreal—it’s just impermanent, ever-shifting: the material world.
  This distinction between Sat and Mithya is further clarified as we explore the meaning of Atman, Bramhan and the different levels of reality we experience.
  A very detailed understanding of the distinction between Sat and Mithya is explored in the <a href="mandukya.html">Mandukya Upanishad</a>. The Mandukya Upanishad, the shortest Upanishad, is only 12 verses long.
  Yet, it is one of the most profound.
</p>
<p> <em> Atmn and Bramhan. </em>


         <p>
      Building on this understanding, the Rishis looked deeper. Beneath the ever-shifting layers of body and mind, they recognized a continuous presence—unchanging and ever-aware. They named this essence <strong>Atman</strong>, the individual Self.
      <br><br>
      Atman is not separate from us—it is our true nature. To illustrate, imagine a room filled with pots. Each pot, like our mind and body, contains air, symbolic of our Atman. While the pots may differ in shape or size, the air within them is not different from the air in other pots, no indeed from air in the room. Likewise, Atman in each of us is not distinct from Brahman, the infinite.
      <br><br>
     Brahman is Sat—unchanging, eternal, and unborn. All that shifts and changes belongs to the realm of Mithya. We are not merely the body or the mind; we are that constant, indivisible presence. We are Atman—and Atman is Brahman.
         Brahman , the sanskrit word comes from the root BRH - which means to grow, expand swell. Brahman is the "ever expanding reality", infinite. It exists beyond all limits of time and space and human conception.
        Atman, the sanskrit word is a composite of "a"+ "tmaan" "A" is a prefix that means towards or into, Tman" is to expand. So atman is the inward expansion of bramhan- "the self" which is not distinct from Bramhan.
    </p>

<p> <em> Levels of reality. </em>    </p>

<p>
    <p> <em> The multiple levels of reality. </em>    </p>
  Having understood that Atman is Brahman—the unchanging essence within us—Vedanta guides us through the various layers of our experience. These are the levels of reality through which we live. Some are temporary; others are permanent.
  <br><br>
  This is the subject matter of the Mandukya Upanishad, which describes these states using the metaphor of a dreamer passing through waking life, dreams, and deep sleep. In brief, we all experience these three impermanent realities, one at a time. All the while, the fourth—the ultimate reality, true, conscious, and eternal—coexists in every state.
  <br><br>
  These three realities are:
  <br><br>
  1. Sthoola Shareera – The reality of our physical existence: the gross body, ruled by the senses and driven by pleasure, pain, and survival.
  <br><br>
  2. Sukshma Shareera – The realm of our thoughts, emotions, desires, and intellect—ever-changing and reactive. What we might today call our "mindspace."
  <br><br>
  3. Sushupti – The causal state: a quiet, unmanifest dimension full of latent potential. Carl Jung called it the collective unconscious. It is that part of our being not yet visible, but with the power to shape future outcomes. Think of it as a flower bud waiting to bloom—or past actions yet to fructify.
  <br><br>
  These three levels of reality belong to the material world.
  <br><br>
  4. Atman – The Self: the silent witness behind all states—unchanging, untouched, eternal.
  <br><br>
  Vedanta affirms that none of the three material realities exist independently of Atman. Using the metaphor of the ocean, these realities are like waves—rising and falling, creating shapes and movements. But no wave exists without water—our Atman. And every droplet of water in the ocean (Brahman) is interchangeable.
  <br><br>
  We must recognize that the exhilaration we experience as a wave is temporary—it collapses back into the water. And the water droplet is the ocean. We are not the wave, but the water—and indeed, not different from the vast ocean itself.
  <br><br>
  This realization dawns differently for each of us. That’s why Vedanta emphasizes tolerance—in two distinct ways: tolerance for the perspectives of others, because they ride different waves and see differently; and tolerance for the crests and troughs we ourselves pass through. Though our paths vary, we are all journeying toward the same truth—from many forms, through many states, toward the One.

        <p> <em>Modern analogy: The computer </em>
    </p>

            <p>
  Think of yourself like a computer. Your brain is the hardware.
                Your thoughts and emotions are the software. But you—the real you—are the electricity.
                The hardware might break. The software may crash. But the electricity remains untouched.
                You are not the program. You are not the machine. You are the power that makes it run.
</p>


        <p> <em> The same quest: Modern science and Vedanta</em>
    </p>
        <p>
  Modern science shares its quest with Vedanta .
            Quantum physics tells us matter is not solid—it’s mostly empty space.
            Particles appear and disappear in and out of existance in empty space.
            Observation affects reality. Particles that are entangled communicate with each other mysteriously.
            Science asks: What is empty space ? How does the universe work at subobservavable scales?<br>
            Vedanta asks the sane questions . The difference hs thus : Science relies on ovserbations,  human or machine,   that are records of 5 perceptions- vision, taste, sound, touch and smell. Vedanta  draws a distinction between observation limited to senory stimuli and observation that is experiential through
            an internal compass - the antah:karana , the internal doer/ recorder.
            Vedanta asks: Can we realize what we are experiencing even when it is not directly visible
            through our senses through a rigourous process of reasoning, listening and experience?

  <p><em>Maya</em>


      <br><br>


How did the universe emerge from the timeless, unobservable Brahman? Unlike the Big Bang theory, Vedanta teaches that Brahman has always existed—there was never a time when it did not exist, nor will there ever be.<br>
Just as a tiny seed contains within it a giant tree waiting to grow, the universe unfolded from Brahman—from an unmanifest, latent state into the manifest, expanding cosmos we observe today.<br><br>

This expansion, however, is not infinite; eventually, dissolution will occur, and the universe will return to a dormant seed-like state, ready to begin the cycle anew.<br>
The birth and death of the universe are bound by time, but Brahman exists beyond both time and space.<br><br>

The current scientific cyclical view of the universe aligns closely with this ancient Vedantic philosophy.<br><br>

Vedanta is not silent on the process by which this cosmic “tree” emerges.<br>
The nourishment that enables creation comes from <b>Maya</b>—the all-encompassing creative power.<br>
Maya operates through two essential forces that work together to bring forth creation: <b>Avarna Shakti</b>, the power to color, veil, or conceal, and <b>Vikshep Shakti</b>, the power to project or manifest.<br><br>

For example, imagine walking down a dark alley and accidentally kicking a thick rope.<br>
Unable to see the rope clearly (your perception is blocked due to darkness or <i>Avarna</i>), your mind projects (through <i>Vikshep</i>) the image of a snake, perhaps triggered by memory or fear.<br><br>

In that moment, your “reality” includes a snake that does not actually exist.<br>
Later, with greater clarity and information, you realize the snake was an illusion—a <i>mithya</i>, a temporary appearance.<br><br>

Simply put: you are real, but what you experience is temporary.<br><br>

On a larger scale, this is how Maya functions to create the universe.<br>
The ancient Rishis understood that the material world is <i>mithya</i>—an illusion or transient appearance (though this transient may span more than 14 billion years)—and that the only true reality (<i>sat</i>) is Brahman.

  <p><em>Lifting the veil<br> <br>Avarnas</em></p>


 <p>
    If we are infinite, then why is there pain and inadequacy in the first place?
  </p>
  <p>
    Vedanta says it’s because we are unaware the power within us can lift us out from any temporary wobble.
   Like the musk deer that roamed the Himalayas, unaware that the fragrance in the air was released from its own body,
      we too do not know our own potential and instead chase external sources in search of peace and happiness when all along it lies within us.
  </p>

  <p>
   The frgrance you are
  </p>

  <p>
    The musk deer wandered, lost in trance,<br>
    Chasing scent like a sacred dance.<br>
    A hint of love, a holy sign—<br>
    A fragrance soft, almost divine.<br><br>

    It searched through valleys, peaks, and mist,<br>
    Believing bliss was just next twist.<br>
    But step by step, and breath by breath,<br>
    It chased that scent until its death.<br><br>

    It never saw. How could it know?<br>
    The source was in it, all aglow.<br>
    That love it chased, that sacred spark,<br>
    Was always burning in its heart.
  </p>

  <p>This veil, called "avarna", means that which colours - or covers up, can be further understood by three examples.</p>

  <p>

    As fire is covered by smoke, a mirror by dust, and an embryo is constricted in the womb,
    so is knowledge covered by this (this = desire and grief).
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
  Smoke and fire:<br>
When smoke veils a fire, the fire is eclipsed even though it has not died.  Momentarily obscured, it can be fanned back to life with relative ease.<br>
In the same way, we are often consumed by desire (kāma), attraction (raga) and avoidance (dwesha). These material trappings 
           eclipse  the realization that we can be free and happy even when these  material desires 
           are not achieved. A little ghee, or fanning thr fire will resolve the problem . 
    </li>

    <li>
    Dust Covering a Mirror:<br>
Requires a little more effort to uncover.<br>
This metaphor was drafted in an era when mirrors were made 
           of metal. To resume the reflectivity, it needed to be polished. 
           Uninterrupted effort (sadhana), study, and self-discipline.
    </li>

    <li>
      Embryo constrained in the womb:<br>
When deep and underdeveloped ideas veil the truth, effort us not enough. Time is also needed resolve a conflict.<br>
Several verses in the Bhagwad Gita exemplify these avaranas. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Each veil corresponds to a phase of spiritual maturity,
    Correct diagnosis will lead to a path forward — these veils of ignorance are extensively the subject of
      the Upanishad and also the Bhagwad Gita which offeres the path of
  karma yoga, jñāna yoga, bhakti yoga respectively.<br>
      [3.39, 4.42, 5.11.6,25, 18.30]<br>       
           [4.38,6.5,5.27–28,13.11,14.11]<br>
           [2.13, 4.34, 7.19,15.11,18.66]

     <p><em>Dharma, Artha,Kama and Moksha</em></p>



    <p>
    In my corporate life, I often heard the phrase, “What got you here won’t get you there.” What they meant was that hard work can take you far—but not all the way. To truly lead, to run a business well and take it forward, you need something beyond effort. You need vision. And in that sense, this wisdom isn’t far from how Vedanta structures the human journey.

Vedanta speaks of four goals: Kama, Artha, Dharma, and Moksha. Kama is the pursuit of desire and enjoyment—about fulfilling immediate wants. Artha is material prosperity; it introduces time into the equation, enabling you to fulfill desires later through accumulated wealth. Dharma is a step further removed—righteous living. Here, your actions uphold a greater order, and you earn punya, or merit, which may bear fruit not just now but in future lives.

These three—Kama, Artha, and Dharma—make up the first path. They operate within effort, time, and results. But Moksha, the fourth goal, is something entirely different. It is not about striving or acquiring—it’s about vision. The vision of the self as whole, free, and already complete. Just as leadership in the corporate world demands something beyond hard work, Moksha demands a shift beyond doing—it calls for knowing. And that vision, according to Vedanta, is what ultimately liberates.
</p>
     <p><em>Rebirth vs Moksha </em></p>
<p>  The idea that life had no begining and no end , that our existance had no boundaries is
    the foundation of  Vedant, but is alien to modern western thought. The Gita describes life as the
    indweller in out body, ( Gita 2,20). Just as we discard old clothes when we get new ones, so the immortal indweller in our bodies
    acquires a new body when the old body dies. <br>
    It goes on to say that nothing can touch this in-dweller- not weapons, not fire, not water and not the wind.
    Rebirth therefore take away an urgency- if you outlive every worldly episode; war, floods, fire ... then nothing
    has control over you - except you yourself. <br> Achievement is devalued by rebirth - after all if you don't get success , you
    have infinite chances. what gains prominance is freedom, peace snd contentment. <br> This comes
    with surrendering control over the world and gaining control over yourself.
 That is why Vedant does not advocate changing the world, it advocates understanding yourself, and until you do, you
    have multiple chances to return , to figure it out<br>

  </p>
  <p><em>Sites of Practice - Empty space</em>

In 2021, I conducted a project called “Sites of Practice” as part of my  MA in Art and Science, at Central Saint Martins. It took me on a journey to
explore a site that is present all around us- “Empty space”, My hypothesis is that this site is
fictional. It does not exist. That, What we call empty is rich with a wealth of information invisible and unseen to
our naked eye or any of our senses.
As I begin my exploration, I ask myself three questions: what, how and why.
What is empty space?
Is it a pause? The gap in time between two discrete sounds? Is the the space around an objects
which helps to define its boundary? .
How do we experience empty space?
Is it possible that the universe is continuous but our senses simply limit perception to discrete
packets and not see what lies in the “ empty space” in between? Perhaps it is our senses, and not
the universe that is limited.
Why does it matter?
If empty space is really a matrix rich with infinite invisible possibilities can we go beyond our five
senses to explore and experience the invisible ? Not in the far flung corners of the the universe ,
not in the pursuit of esoteric philosophy and religion, but in between every experience of ours, can
we find that which is infinite? Here and now.
To explore this hypothesis I approach my work through three lenses. The lens of a scientific
researcher, a Vedantic practitioner and that of an experimenter.
